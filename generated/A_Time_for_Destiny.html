<h2 id="the-venusian-staff-of-power">1. The Venusian Staff of Power</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. There was an air conditioning unit off in the distance. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the communications panel. She was a bit on the short side, but in a cute way, with perky shoulder length rainbow hued hair and indigo eyes. She had a wicked cute forehead, the sort you only see in old movies. She was looking fine in an exquisite crimson denim tank top with purple and gold star patterns and some gold coloured polyester trousers with purple polyester trim. Some marvellous crimson and violet denim dress shoes adorned with emeralds graced her feet.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the view screen.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the communications panel. &quot;Hello, Commander Joe,&quot; he whispered with an enigmatic twitch of his nose. He was looking exciting in a maroon silk great coat. He was rather tall, with short black hair and brown eyes. He had a wide brow that the other kids teased back when he was a kid. On his feet he wore some brown cotton boots.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was standing near the air conditioning unit. She was of average height, with shoulder length blonde hair and green eyes. She had a narrow mouth, the type you only see in comic books. She was studiously buffing the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;That Venusian Staff of Power, it's kind of special, isn't it?&quot; asked Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Fighters Command doesn't entrust us with just any old thing, Serenity Starlight,&quot; Tammy Smith drawled fawningly. From out of nowhere, a delivery drone flew close by her head. &quot;What was that?&quot; she groaned acidly. She grimaced acidly. She was wearing a black polyester jersey and some blue nylon slacks. The green silk trainers that she had on looked almost new. She looked around. With a exquisite yet powerful motion, she lifted the Venusian Staff of Power into the light. Without warning, she stubbed her toe. The Venusian Staff of Power slipped out of her grasp.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>A embarrassed look crept across Navigator Tammy Smith's face.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury glanced slowly at her. He was quite tall, but really handsomely tall, not freakishly tall, with long auburn hair and blue eyes. He had a perfect brow that he inherited from from his father.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight looked at Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James glared in the direction of Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. He held the cup of coffee in his hand. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; he he saidavily.</p>
<p>From out of nowhere, a surveillance drone flew close by Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's head. &quot;What was that?&quot; she shouted threateningly. She frowned outrageously.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury motioned her to step aside from the others for a moment. &quot;There's something I wanted to talk about&quot;, he began painingly. He was looking delightful in a snappy green leather jacket and some snappy blue green cotton culottes. His feet were shod in some yellow dacron boots.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, about last night in the mess hall...&quot; gulped Joe Mulbury painingly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went beet red with blushing. &quot;Speak not of it, Joe Mulbury&quot; she whispered coyly. She surveyed the area with her eyes. She all of a sudden had a odd inkling. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; shouted Dwight Edgmont. &quot;You displayed some quick thinking today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; he smiled energetically. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; he sighed energetically.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Dwight Edgmont!&quot; whispered Ensign Serenity, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. &quot;I'm too modest, I like being a Ensign too!&quot;. &quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; giggled Commander Joe firmly.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a curry right now,&quot; sighed Captain Dwight fawningly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith slumped down on the bean bag chair.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Venusian Staff of Power, Navigator Tammy,&quot; drawled Commander Joe obsequiously.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="1"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-chalice-of-dreams">2. The Chalice of Dreams</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. A navigation dashboard gleamed in the fluorescent light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the air conditioning unit. She was looking smashing in a dark indigo nylon smock with shiny purple lightning bolt patterns. Some fantastic multi hued crinkly foil boots with silvery star patterns were on her feet.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the Captain's chair. He was looking fine in a black rayon great coat. The handsome tan polyester sandals that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Commander Joe,&quot; whispered Captain Dwight Edgmont obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;I have just come back from the kitchen and it looks like we are plum out of nutri worms,&quot; said Navigator Tammy Smith virtuously. She was looking frumpy in a bleak pinstripe silk halter top and some gaudy silver coloured crinkly foil slacks. Her feet were shod with some blue crinkly foil trainers. &quot;Hello, Joe Mulbury,&quot; she whispered obsequiously.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was cracking open walnuts with the Chalice of Dreams. His short black hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. He was resplendent in a floral print rayon hoodie and some blue green dacron culottes with mauve stripes. On his feet he wore some mauve leather boots with silver coloured stripes.</p>
<p>&quot;That Chalice of Dreams means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the sort of thing you can just order off Omnizon, Navigator Tammy,&quot; Captain Dwight chirped obsequiously.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was studiously cleaning the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That Star Jewel of Eternity means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;It means a lot to all of us, Serenity Starlight,&quot; Commander Joe stated enigmatically. His perfect brow in profile threw a shadow on the pulsing red and green lights. He surveyed the area. He lifted the Star Jewel of Eternity into the light. Just then, he stumbled. He lost his grip on the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>The Star Jewel of Eternity tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Oopsie-daisy,&quot; mumbled Commander Joe quietly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy glared in the direction of him.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont moved his exquisite yet confident hand in the direction of Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James pointed towards Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a surveillance drone whizzed past Captain Dwight Edgmont's head. &quot;What in blazes was that?&quot; he sighed lightly. He beamed firmly. He looked around. He held the Chalice of Dreams in his hand. All of a sudden, he lost his balance. He lost his grip on the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>The Chalice of Dreams tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Drat,&quot; whispered Dwight Edgmont quietly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy looked at him. Her narrow mouth in profile cast a shadow against the communications panel.</p>
<p>Commander Joe gestured towards Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity moved her supple yet firm arm in the direction of Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>With a smooth yet confident motion, Joe Mulbury picked up the star charts that were nearby. He held the star charts in his hand. &quot;These star charts represents how I feel inside,&quot; he muttered downheartedly.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James gestured to him to step away from the others for a moment. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her perky shoulder length rainbow hued locks. &quot;There's a thing I need to say to you&quot;, she groaned awkwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Ensign Serenity?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, about the other day in the mess hall...&quot; whispered Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James painfully.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury blushed a deep red. &quot;It's all right, Ensign Serenity, you don't need to say anything,&quot; he sighed awkwardly.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity surveyed the area with her eyes. She all of a sudden had a funny inkling. She looked behind the nearby Captain's chair. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; yelped Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James looked around. She all of a sudden had a unusual inkling. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; cried Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;That was some top notch action I saw from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; breathed Dwight Edgmont enigmatically. &quot;I think I should promote you to Lieutenant, Ensign Serenity!&quot; he breathed lightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; drawled Serenity Starlight happily. &quot;It's enough to know I'm fighting on the side of good!&quot;. &quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; she sighed energetically.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; said Joe Mulbury obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; chirped Dwight Edgmont fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a pizza right now,&quot; giggled Navigator Tammy enigmatically. &quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Commander Joe,&quot; she giggled courageously.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="2"></a></p>
<h2 id="nebulon-the-dastardly">3. Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you'd expect. In the centre of the area were some pulsing red and green lights. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>&quot;I have just come back from the pantry and it looks like we are plum out of eggs,&quot; stated Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James calmly. She was looking fine in a fantastic crimson polyester dress with red and purple star patterns. The purple and gold dacron dress shoes with shimmering rainbow coloured star patterns that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the view screen. &quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he drawled with an enigmatic twitch of his mouth. His perfect brow seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Ensign Serenity,&quot; whispered Captain Dwight Edgmont with an enigmatic twitch of his ears.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Joe Mulbury,&quot; smiled Navigator Tammy Smith fawningly. She put her hand up to her narrow mouth. She was looking completely unimpressive in a gold coloured dacron jersey and some red nylon slacks with gaudy purple polka dots. On her feet she wore some red cotton trainers.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was cracking open walnuts with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That Star Jewel of Eternity, it's pretty special, isn't it?&quot; asked Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Fighters Command doesn't entrust us with just any old thing, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; Ensign Serenity said calmly. Her wicked cute forehead seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. She looked around. She lifted the Star Jewel of Eternity into the light. Suddenly, she lost her balance. The Star Jewel of Eternity slipped out of her hand.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>A sour look crept across Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's face.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith glanced irritatedly at her.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury moved his soft yet powerful arm in the direction of Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight gestured towards Ms. O'James. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his short black hair.</p>
<p>With a smooth yet powerful motion, Joe Mulbury picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. He was sporting a violet crinkly foil jacket and some handsome purple crinkly foil culottes. Some handsome pink silk shoes were on his feet. He lifted the electro wrench to eye level. &quot;This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,&quot; he gasped sadly. With a gentle yet firm motion, he gestured to Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James to step back from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I wanted to talk about&quot;, he gulped carefully.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Ensign Serenity.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, about that time in the mess hall...&quot; said Commander Joe slowly.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity went beet red with blushing. &quot;Words are not necessary, Commander Joe&quot; she gasped awkwardly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was gotten up in a blood red rayon jersey and some black cotton slacks with deep black stripes. His feet were shod with some midnight black crinkly foil sneakers.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Nebulon!&quot; Captain Dwight cried. He was wearing a tan rayon top and some handsome pinstripe nylon culottes. The blue green leather shoes on his feet seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled disdainfully. &quot;I have you now!&quot; he sighed with a voice like charcoal in a gymnasium parking lot. He was rather tall, with close cropped green hair and green eyes. His jutting chin complemented his other features nicely. He snatched Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with him.</p>
<p>Commander Joe put his hands to the sides of his face in surprise.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont's mouth gawped wide in shock.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; shouted Ms. O'James gratingly. With a exquisite yet forceful motion, she picked up the star charts that were nearby. She held the star charts in her hand. &quot;These star charts represents how I feel inside,&quot; she said menacingly.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the Nebulon's fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. A door to the dungeon seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Bees buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the creeps,&quot; droned Serenity Starlight unhappily. The beautiful pale indigo dacron suit jacket with white denim trim she was looking smashing in seemed to shine in the dim torch light. The fantastic shiny purple silk trainers with black and purple lightning bolt patterns that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro measurements look normal,&quot; intoned Joe Mulbury, looking down at the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!&quot; mumbled Ms. O'James drily.</p>
<p>Walking along, Dwight Edgmont suddenly whacked his head against an invisible force field. He was sporting a fine pinstripe denim suit jacket with chartreuse stripes and some red cotton culottes. On his feet he wore some violet crinkly foil sandals.</p>
<p>&quot;What in the world was that?&quot; groaned Joe Mulbury enigmatically. Walking along, he suddenly whacked his head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no way we can get through this we'll have to find another way in!&quot; said Dwight Edgmont laughingly. &quot;We have a duty to retrieve the Star Jewel of Eternity!&quot; he stated enigmatically.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight mumbled slowly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage! She was gotten up in a brown nylon jumper and some tacky mauve cotton slacks. Some gaudy violet rayon pixie boots were on her feet.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been toast without you, Commander Joe,&quot; she sighed laughingly. &quot;Thank you, Captain Dwight,&quot; she chirped calmly. &quot;I am in debt to you, Ensign Serenity,&quot; she giggled laughingly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you'd expect. An air conditioning unit gleamed in the fluorescent light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight surveyed the area with her eyes. She was looking smashing in a beautiful shiny purple cotton shirt with pale indigo dacron trim and some beautiful dark violet nylon culottes with frilly silver coloured lace. Her feet were shod in some elegant silvery dacron pumps with purple and violet star patterns. She suddenly had a odd intuition. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; shouted Dwight Edgmont. He was looking exciting in a pinstripe leather suit jacket and some green nylon slacks with pinstripe stripes. His feet were shod with some handsome white nylon trainers. &quot;I saw you display some ace thinking today, Ms. O'James!&quot; he drawled energetically. &quot;I think I should promote you to Lieutenant, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; he smiled fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; blushed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James fawningly. &quot;I'm not in this for rank, I do it out of love!&quot;. With a exquisite yet firm motion, she slumped down on the sofa.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Commander Joe. He was decked out in a tie dyed silk hoodie and some snappy gold coloured crinkly foil trousers with floral print cotton trim. Some navy blue denim shoes were on his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; breathed Navigator Tammy lightly. &quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Ms. O'James,&quot; she sighed calmly.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="3"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-return-of-the-venusian-staff-of-power">4. The Return of The Venusian Staff of Power</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. In the centre of the area was a communications panel. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the navigation dashboard. She was looking delightful in a beautiful crimson and violet polyester jumpsuit with purple lightning bolt patterns. Her perky shoulder length rainbow hued hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. On her feet she wore some shimmering multi hued nylon shoes with shimmering purple star patterns.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Ms. O'James,&quot; whispered Commander Joe Mulbury with an enigmatic twitch of his ears.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the navigation dashboard. He was wearing a gold coloured nylon long coat. The handsome white denim sandals that were on his feet looked almost new. His wide brow in profile threw a shadow on the communications panel. &quot;Hello, Commander Joe,&quot; he giggled placidly. He was cracking open pecans with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;That Saturnian Orb of Hope means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Commander Joe. He put his hand up to his perfect brow.</p>
<p>&quot;It means a lot to all of us, Joe Mulbury,&quot; Dwight Edgmont said obsequiously. He was meticulously cleaning the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;That Venusian Staff of Power, it's kind of special, isn't it?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the kind of thing you can just order from Omnizon, Ensign Serenity,&quot; Captain Dwight giggled placidly. He looked around. He lifted the Venusian Staff of Power into the light. All of a sudden, he was distracted. The Venusian Staff of Power slipped out of his grasp.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;Oops,&quot; whispered Captain Dwight quietly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith gestured towards him. She was gotten up in a blue rayon frock and some purple silk culottes with a tacky blue zig zag pattern. On her feet she wore some mauve polyester sneakers.</p>
<p>Commander Joe moved his gentle yet powerful hand in the direction of Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity glared in the direction of Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. He held the cup of coffee in his hand. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; he giggled courageously. He wasn't going to let a little thing like this affect his mood, though.</p>
<p>Commander Joe gestured to Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James to step back from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I wanted to talk about&quot;, he breathed carefully.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, about that time in the loading bay...&quot; breathed Joe Mulbury painfully.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James blushed a deep red. She held her finger up to Commander Joe Mulbury's lips.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight surveyed the area with his eyes. He lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope into the light. Without warning, he stubbed his toe. He lost his grip on the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>The Saturnian Orb of Hope tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A crestfallen look crept across Captain Dwight Edgmont's face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy moved her soft yet forceful hand in the direction of him.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury looked at Dwight Edgmont. He was looking smashing in a fine green rayon hoodie and some maroon polyester trousers. The blue crinkly foil sneakers he was looking delightful in seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity glanced grumpily at Captain Dwight. Out of the blue, a cooking drone buzzed by her head. &quot;What in blazes was that?&quot; she muttered exasperatedly. She frowned icily. She looked around. She all of a sudden had a strange inkling. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; shouted Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity surveyed the area. She suddenly had a hunch. She looked behind the nearby air conditioning unit. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; cried Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;That was some ace thinking I saw from you today, Serenity Starlight!&quot; giggled Dwight Edgmont lightly. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant, Ensign Serenity!&quot; he sighed firmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Dwight Edgmont!&quot; drawled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. &quot;It's enough to know I'm fighting on the side of good!&quot;. &quot;I could really go for a pizza right now,&quot; she sighed fawningly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury flumped down on the bean bag chair.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; sighed Captain Dwight calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; said Tammy Smith laughingly.</p>

<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. There was a navigation dashboard off in the corner. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the Captain's chair. She was decked out in a marvellous shimmering purple leather blouse with purple and violet lightning bolt patterns and some marvellous crimson and violet polyester trousers with violet star patterns. The exquisite violet dacron pixie boots with white star patterns that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; said Commander Joe Mulbury with an enigmatic twitch of his nose. The handsome orange red dacron hoodie with black stripes he was looking delightful in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. Some tan silk dress shoes were on his feet.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the view screen.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the communications panel. Her narrow mouth in profile cast a shadow against the air conditioning unit. She was wearing a bleak plaid cotton jersey with a tacky blue zig zag pattern and some navy blue crinkly foil trousers with a tacky black zig zag pattern. Her feet were shod in some yellow cotton shoes. &quot;Hello, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; she drawled placidly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; she sighed lightly. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her perky shoulder length rainbow hued hair.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury motioned her to step back from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I need to talk about&quot;, he began painfully. His perfect brow in profile threw a shadow on the navigation dashboard.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, about that time in the engine room...&quot; said Commander Joe painfully.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight went beet red with blushing. &quot;Hush, Joe Mulbury, there's no need, you know that,&quot; she gasped slowly.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a cooking drone buzzed by Commander Joe Mulbury's head. &quot;What in Sam Hill was that?&quot; he bellowed strongly. He frowned emphatically.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; bellowed Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled maniacally. He was looking intimidating in a fine dark black polyester track suit. The dark black crinkly foil trainers with blood red silk trim he was looking villanous in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. &quot;We meet again, kiddies!&quot; he sighed with a voice like a gorilla at a square dance. He snatched Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made gestures of shock with her arms.</p>
<p>Commander Joe shouted &quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; barked Ms. O'James with a voice like a rabid dog in a performance art piece.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where that villian has taken Dwight Edgmont!&quot; yelled Joe Mulbury emphatically.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Dwight Edgmont is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; groaned Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; screamed Commander Joe emphatically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. A door to the dungeon seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Gnats buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; muttered Ms. O'James drily. She was looking delightful in a crimson polyester dress adorned with jewels. Her feet were shod with some exquisite dark indigo rayon shoes with dark violet lightning bolt patterns.</p>
<p>With a graceful yet forceful motion, Navigator Tammy opened up the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro measurements look normal,&quot; splurted Tammy Smith gratingly. The gaudy violet leather top with a tacky navy blue zig zag pattern she was gotten up in seemed to shine in the dim torch light. On her feet she wore some red cotton trainers with a tacky brown zig zag pattern.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a PIT!!&quot; intoned Ensign Serenity drily.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>&quot;What was that noise?&quot; she gasped.</p>
<p>Without warning, with a tremendous bang, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury just stared, seemingly paralyzed. He was sporting a snappy violet rayon hoodie and some handsome white nylon slacks. The orange red cotton sneakers that he had on looked almost new. He was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith's mouth gawped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James gulped &quot;NOOO!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We must act quickly!&quot; Navigator Tammy droned. She helped dig Joe Mulbury out from the rubble.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James wasted no time. She helped dig Commander Joe out from the rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; drawled Commander Joe peacefully. &quot;I am indebted to you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he breathed obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Navigator Tammy chirped firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage! He was looking ready for action in a black leather top and some purple dacron culottes. His wide brow in profile cast a shadow against the manacles. Some blue green nylon dress shoes were on his feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been a goner without you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he chirped enigmatically. &quot;Thank you, Commander Joe,&quot; he whispered calmly. &quot;I would have been lost without you, Ms. O'James,&quot; he breathed happily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you'd expect. A communications panel seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw you display some ace action today, Ms. O'James!&quot; smiled Dwight Edgmont firmly. &quot;I think I should promote you to Lieutenant, Ensign Serenity!&quot; he whispered placidly. He was resplendent in a silver coloured rayon trench coat. Some yellow denim sneakers were on his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; drawled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James firmly. She was sporting a shimmering rainbow hued crinkly foil jacket adorned with emeralds and some silvery leather slacks adorned with gems. The fantastic red and purple silk pixie boots with blue and purple moon beam patterns that were on her feet looked almost new. &quot;I'm not in this for rank, I do it out of love!&quot;. &quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; she breathed obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Joe Mulbury. He was looking smashing in a snappy navy blue nylon jumpsuit. His feet were shod in some pinstripe cotton trainers.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a pizza after that,&quot; chirped Dwight Edgmont blissfully.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith slumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="5"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-revenge-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">6. The Revenge of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you'd expect. Some pulsing red and green lights gleamed in the fluorescent light. A few Space Mosquitoes buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;I have just come back from the pantry and it looks like we are fresh out of nutri worms,&quot; said Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James calmly. She was looking fine in a marvellous deep indigo nylon sweater with dark purple moon beam patterns and some exquisite shimmering purple polyester trousers with crimson lightning bolt patterns. On her feet she wore some marvellous red and purple dacron pumps with violet denim trim.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the communications panel. He was looking delightful in a floral print denim sweater and some navy blue leather slacks with white silk trim. On his feet he wore some blue green nylon dress shoes. His perfect brow seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. &quot;Hello, Ensign Serenity,&quot; he sighed with an enigmatic twitch of his mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Ms. O'James,&quot; whispered Captain Dwight Edgmont enigmatically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was playing that new match three game on her hyper crystal. She was wearing a gold coloured polyester jerkin with gaudy silver coloured polka dots and some tacky pink silk culottes with a tacky floral print zig zag pattern. She put her hand up to her narrow mouth. Her feet were shod with some tasteless maroon silk pixie boots.</p>
<p>With a supple yet forceful motion, Dwight Edgmont picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. His short black hair seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. He was wearing a blue rayon shirt and some floral print dacron slacks with blue green silk trim. The gold coloured denim boots on his feet seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. He held the electro wrench in his hand. &quot;This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,&quot; he breathed courageously.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;Nebulon!&quot; Tammy Smith yelled.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled evilly. He was looking villanous in a black dacron track suit. The midnight black nylon shoes with blood coloured stripes that were on his feet looked almost new. &quot;So sorry to spoil your party, kiddies!&quot; he said with a voice like a gangster in a gymnasium parking lot. He snatched Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with him.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith made motions of shock with her arms.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont clapped his hands to the sides of his face in shock.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James put her hands to her cheeks in shock.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where Joe Mulbury is being held!&quot; giggled Captain Dwight energetically.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Commander Joe is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; muttered Serenity Starlight emphatically.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; cried Dwight Edgmont enigmatically. He picked up the star charts that were nearby. He lifted the star charts into the light. &quot;These star charts represents how I feel inside,&quot; he drawled calmly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Nebulon appeared! His jutting chin seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; shouted Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wildly. &quot;What have we here!&quot; he sighed with a voice like a samurai in a bazaar. He snatched Navigator Tammy from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with him.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont's mouth gawped wide in shock.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James yelled &quot;NOOO!&quot;.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. There was a puddle of icky looking liquid off in the distance. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the willies,&quot; intoned Tammy Smith unhappily. She was looking completely unimpressive in a tacky yellow polyester tank top with gaudy mauve polka dots and some navy blue nylon culottes with gaudy chartreuse polka dots. Some maroon denim sneakers with gaudy red polka dots were on her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro metrics look normal,&quot; intoned Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James, gazing down at the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. She was sporting a crimson and purple leather shirt with black and purple star patterns and some elegant dark purple dacron trousers adorned with jewels. On her feet she wore some marvellous multi coloured nylon dress shoes with rainbow coloured star patterns.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, normal... for a DISASTER AREA!!&quot; mumbled Navigator Tammy heavily.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Ensign Serenity yelled firmly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indebted to you, Captain Dwight,&quot; she whispered firmly. &quot;Thank you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; she giggled strongly.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear something?&quot; Captain Dwight said.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy stood frozen like a deer in headlights. She was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;NOOO!&quot; squealed Dwight Edgmont lightly. He was sporting a mauve cotton jacket and some chartreuse rayon slacks with floral print silk trim. His feet were shod with some orange denim boots.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight made gestures of shock with her arms. Her wicked cute forehead in profile threw a shadow on the door to the dungeon.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! The blood red dacron smock with black stripes she was gotten up in seemed to shine in the dim torch light. Some blood coloured leather pumps with black rayon trim graced her feet. She was rather tall, with long green hair and green eyes. She had a scarred mouth, the sort you only see in Westerns.</p>
<p>&quot;The Skull Witch!&quot; Ensign Serenity screeched.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled evilly. &quot;What have we here!&quot; she stated with a voice like a samurai in a performance art piece. She grabbed Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with her.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity put her hands to her cheeks in shock. &quot;We must find out where Dwight Edgmont is being held!&quot; she yelled menacingly. &quot;I have a strong feeling Captain Dwight is in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon,&quot; she splurted outrageously. &quot;Quickly! We must make our way to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; she screamed exasperatedly. Walking along, she unexpectedly bonked her head against an invisible force field. &quot;There's no way we can get through this we'll have to find another way in!&quot; she muttered slowly. &quot;We have a duty to rescue Navigator Tammy Smith!&quot; she he intonedavily. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she gulped unhappily.</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in debt to you, Ensign Serenity,&quot; he giggled calmly. &quot;There's no time to lose!&quot; he yelled. He helped dig Tammy Smith out from the rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;Hurry!&quot; Ensign Serenity breathed. She helped dig Tammy Smith out from the rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been a goner without you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; giggled Tammy Smith calmly. &quot;Thank you, Ensign Serenity,&quot; she drawled strongly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Badgers came around the corner.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh oh, looks like they've spotted us,&quot; breathed Dwight Edgmont lightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Eus huupjiqf mdsf tfrp rfliahy!!!&quot; shouted the Space Badgers in their strange Space Badger language.</p>
<p>A harrowing battle commenced!</p>
<p>&quot;BY THE RINGS OF MARS!!!&quot; barked Serenity Starlight. She drew the Venusian Katana of Power out of her backpack. She lifted the Venusian Katana of Power over her head. She brought down the Venusian Katana of Power with a tremendous power.</p>
<p>The Venusian Katana of Power made contact with the Space Badgers with a mighty impact.</p>
<p>The Space Badgers went flying across the room. When the dust had settled, dazed Space Badgers were strewn across the area.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close one!&quot; chirped Dwight Edgmont calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;It looked like those Space Badgers had The Skull Witch's insignia on their clothes,&quot; smiled Tammy Smith laughingly. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; gulped Ms. O'James unhappily. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she mumbled drily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage! He was looking smashing in a snappy violet dacron sweater and some snappy purple nylon leggings. The snappy navy blue denim boots that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been lost without you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he smiled courageously. &quot;I am in debt to you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; he stated happily. &quot;I would have been a goner without you, Ms. O'James,&quot; he stated peacefully.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Ensign Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. Nearby were some pulsing red and green lights. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some ace action I saw from you today, Ensign Serenity!&quot; whispered Captain Dwight firmly. He was resplendent in a mauve polyester shirt and some handsome brown denim culottes. The white leather trainers with gold coloured dacron trim that he had on looked almost new. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; he sighed calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; chirped Ms. O'James, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. She was looking smashing in an elegant midnight black nylon jacket adorned with gems and some exquisite crimson and purple nylon trousers with silver coloured lightning bolt patterns. Her feet were shod in some black and purple leather pixie boots with shimmering purple lightning bolt patterns. &quot;I'm too modest, I like being a Ensign too!&quot;. &quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury flumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; breathed Dwight Edgmont energetically.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a hot dog right now,&quot; said Navigator Tammy calmly.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="6"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-space-slugs">7. The Space Slugs</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. A view screen seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the navigation dashboard. She was wearing a beautiful silver and purple dacron halter top adorned with gems and some beautiful purple and white silk trousers with crimson moon beam patterns. Some beautiful gold coloured dacron trainers with dark violet star patterns graced her feet. Her wicked cute forehead in profile cast a shadow against the navigation dashboard.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the communications panel. &quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he whispered with an enigmatic twitch of his nose.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was playing that new match three game on his hyper crystal. He was wearing a tie dyed crinkly foil track suit with black crinkly foil trim. On his feet he wore some brown polyester dress shoes with purple stripes. &quot;Hello, Ms. O'James,&quot; he whispered enigmatically. His short black hair seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was playing that new match three game on her hyper crystal. She was looking completely unimpressive in a navy blue rayon great coat with gaudy violet polka dots. On her feet she wore some tie dyed crinkly foil boots with a tacky tie dyed zig zag pattern. She put her hand up to her narrow mouth.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight was cracking open walnuts with the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;That Chalice of Dreams, it's kind of special, isn't it?&quot; asked Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;It means a lot to all of us, Navigator Tammy,&quot; Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James stated calmly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her long green hair.</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; screeched Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wickedly. &quot;We meet again, chums!&quot; she breathed with a voice like a gorilla in a jewellery store. She snatched Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with her.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith shouted &quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot;.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont's mouth gaped wide in surprise.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity made motions of surprise with her arms. She picked up the star charts that were nearby. She held the star charts in her hand. &quot;These star charts represents how I feel inside,&quot; she muttered threateningly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; bellowed Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled maniacally. He was looking villanous in a dark black leather jacket and some fine deep red dacron culottes with dark black rayon trim. Some blood red nylon boots graced his feet. &quot;I have you now!&quot; he stated with a voice like charcoal driving a race car. He snatched Dwight Edgmont from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with him. He put his hand up to his jutting chin.</p>
<p>&quot;OH NO!&quot; screamed Tammy Smith enigmatically.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James put her hands on her cheeks in shock.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. She lifted the electro wrench into the light. &quot;This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,&quot; she barked exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight looked around. She held the Chalice of Dreams in her hand. All of a sudden, she lost her balance. She lost her grip on the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>The Chalice of Dreams tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Oopsie-daisy,&quot; said Ms. O'James quietly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith pointed towards her.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James surveyed the area. She suddenly had a funny hunch. She looked behind the nearby pulsing red and green lights. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; yelled Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the Nebulon's fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you'd expect. Nearby was a torch in a thing on the wall. A few Space Mosquitoes buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; bleated Tammy Smith enigmatically. She was wearing a violet nylon leotard. The navy blue leather shoes that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>With a supple yet powerful motion, Lieutenant Serenity launched the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro metrics look normal,&quot; drawled Lieutenant Serenity virtuously. The elegant rainbow hued crinkly foil halter top with pale indigo moon beam patterns she was looking delightful in seemed to shine in the dim torch light. Her feet were shod in some exquisite deep indigo cotton pumps with multi coloured lacy frills.</p>
<p>&quot;... For a DUMP!!&quot; bleated Tammy Smith irritatedly.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James picked up the skull of a Space Rat that was nearby. She lifted the skull of a Space Rat into the light. &quot;This skull of a Space Rat represents how I feel inside,&quot; she whispered lightly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Nebulon appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;It's Nebulon!&quot; Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James barked.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wickedly. The dark red crinkly foil shirt he was wearing seemed to gleam in the dim torch light. His feet were shod with some dark black crinkly foil sandals. &quot;So sorry to spoil your little party, kiddies!&quot; he breathed with a voice like a crazed bull at a baseball game. He snatched Navigator Tammy from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with him.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; screamed Serenity Starlight acidly. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she he ragedavily.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Ms. O'James,&quot; she sighed energetically. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she breathed laughingly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indebted to you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he chirped energetically. &quot;I would have been lost without you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; he stated blissfully.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James looked around. She lifted the Chalice of Dreams to eye level. All of a sudden, she lost her balance. The Chalice of Dreams slipped out of her grasp.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>A embarrassed look crept across Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's face.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith gestured towards her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight moved his smooth yet confident arm in the direction of Ms. O'James. He was wearing a blue cotton robe. Some fine white dacron shoes graced his feet.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear something?&quot; he whispered.</p>
<p>Too quickly for anyone to react, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy stood frozen like a deer in headlights. She was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont made gestures of disbelief with his arms.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity gasped &quot;NOOO!&quot;.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Badgers attacked Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>A fierce battle began!</p>
<p>&quot;BY THE RINGS OF MARS!!!&quot; screeched Lieutenant Serenity. She drew the Venusian Katana of Power out of her backpack. She raised the Venusian Katana of Power above her head. She brought down the Venusian Katana of Power with a mighty force.</p>
<p>The Venusian Katana of Power made contact with the Space Badgers with a mighty whack.</p>
<p>The Space Badgers went flying across the room. When the dust had settled, dazed Space Badgers were strewn across the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close call!&quot; groaned Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James emphatically. &quot;It looked like those Space Badgers had Nebulon the Dastardly's insignia on their jerseys,&quot; she said strongly. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We must act quickly!&quot; Dwight Edgmont sighed. He helped dig Navigator Tammy out from the rubble.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James wasted no time. She helped dig Navigator Tammy out from the rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in debt to you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; breathed Navigator Tammy obsequiously. &quot;Thank you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; she sighed energetically.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James were attacked by some Space Slugs.</p>
<p>A intense skirmish commenced!</p>
<p>&quot;BY THE MOUNTAINS OF MARS!!!&quot; bellowed Navigator Tammy. She drew the electro mace out of her backpack. She heaved the electro mace over her head. She brought down the electro mace with a mighty force.</p>
<p>The electro mace made contact with the Space Slugs with a mighty whack.</p>
<p>The Space Slugs went flying across the room. When the dust had cleared, stunned Space Slugs were strewn across the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close call!&quot; sighed Dwight Edgmont laughingly. &quot;It looked like those Space Slugs had The Skull Witch's insignia on their jerseys,&quot; he sighed courageously. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; intoned Navigator Tammy slowly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James surveyed the area. She suddenly had a funny hunch. She looked behind the nearby puddle of icky looking liquid. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; exclaimed Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James sighed energetically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage! He was looking smashing in some fine gold coloured polyester coveralls. The fine silver coloured polyester sandals that he had on looked almost new. The dim torch light of the stronghold fortress of Nebulon cast highlights on his long auburn locks.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he drawled strongly. &quot;I am indebted to you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; he smiled enigmatically. &quot;I would have been lost without you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; he chirped peacefully.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. There was an air conditioning unit off in the distance. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;You displayed some quick thinking today, Lieutenant Serenity!&quot; said Captain Dwight enigmatically. He was looking exciting in an orange red crinkly foil shirt and some maroon dacron leggings. The chartreuse polyester boots on his feet seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Commander, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; he drawled placidly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; whispered Ms. O'James firmly. The marvellous pale purple rayon leotard with purple and gold moon beam patterns she was sporting seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. On her feet she wore some elegant purple and gold cotton sandals with shiny purple star patterns. &quot;I'm too modest, I like being a Lieutenant too!&quot;. &quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; she giggled calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; whispered Commander Joe blissfully.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont slumped down on the bean bag chair.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Chalice of Dreams, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; stated Captain Dwight courageously.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-return-of-the-chalice-of-dreams">8. The Return of The Chalice of Dreams</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. A communications panel gleamed in the fluorescent light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the Captain's chair. She was looking delightful in an exquisite crimson and violet rayon blouse with crimson and violet lightning bolt patterns and some exquisite deep violet dacron leggings with frilly gold coloured lace. On her feet she wore some fantastic pale indigo leather sneakers with deep indigo moon beam patterns.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the view screen. He was looking impressive in a blue dacron jumper and some navy blue denim trousers. His feet were shod in some mauve crinkly foil trainers with red crinkly foil trim.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the air conditioning unit. His wide brow seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. &quot;Hello, Commander Joe,&quot; he smiled with an enigmatic twitch of his nose. He was looking exciting in a gold coloured denim suit jacket and some fine blue green polyester culottes with green rayon trim. Some black leather trainers were on his feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights. She was looking tastless in a violet rayon blouse with gaudy white polka dots and some orange denim trousers with gaudy pinstripe polka dots. The red rayon sneakers with gaudy silver coloured polka dots that were on her feet looked almost new. Her narrow mouth in profile threw a shadow on the Captain's chair.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was intently buffing the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;That Chalice of Dreams means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Fighters Command doesn't entrust us with just any old thing, Commander Joe,&quot; Captain Dwight chirped lightly. He was cracking open walnuts with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;That Saturnian Orb of Hope means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the type of thing you can just order from Omnizon, Tammy Smith,&quot; Dwight Edgmont breathed strongly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was looking menacing in a fine dark black cotton top and some blood coloured crinkly foil culottes. On his feet he wore some fine blood red leather dress shoes.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Nebulon!&quot; Captain Dwight yelped.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wickedly. &quot;We meet again, chums!&quot; he giggled with a voice like a gangster at a baseball game. He grabbed Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith's mouth gaped wide in surprise.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont's mouth gaped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>&quot;NOOO!&quot; barked Serenity Starlight with a voice like a crazed bull in a performance art piece. Her perky shoulder length rainbow hued hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where that villian has taken Commander Joe!&quot; chirped Captain Dwight calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Joe Mulbury is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; muttered Lieutenant Serenity heavily.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; yelled Dwight Edgmont enigmatically.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. She held the electro wrench in her hand. &quot;This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,&quot; she said enigmatically.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont looked around. He held the Chalice of Dreams in his hand. Without warning, he stubbed his toe. He lost his grip on the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>The Chalice of Dreams tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A sheepish look crept across Captain Dwight Edgmont's face.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith glared in the direction of him.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight pointed towards Dwight Edgmont. With a graceful yet firm motion, she picked up the star charts that were nearby. She lifted the star charts. &quot;These star charts represents how I feel inside,&quot; she gasped exasperatedly. She surveyed the area. She all of a sudden had a strange intuition. She looked behind the nearby Captain's chair. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; exclaimed Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. A torch in a thing on the wall gleamed in the dim torch light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the chills,&quot; intoned Navigator Tammy unhappily.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro measurements look normal,&quot; chirped Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James, looking down at the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. She was wearing a marvellous purple and violet polyester robe adorned with sapphires. Her feet were shod with some elegant silver coloured leather trainers with multi coloured lightning bolt patterns.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!&quot; mumbled Navigator Tammy downheartedly. She was gotten up in a tacky floral print crinkly foil dress. The pink nylon shoes she was looking completely unimpressive in seemed to shine in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont looked around. He lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope to eye level. Suddenly, he tripped. He was looking exciting in a chartreuse leather smock. Some handsome silver coloured polyester sneakers graced his feet. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of his hand.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoopsy-daisy,&quot; sighed Dwight Edgmont quietly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith looked at him.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight glanced slowly at Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, Nebulon appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; screamed Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. He was looking intimidating in a fine blood red rayon trench coat. The snappy deep black polyester dress shoes with blood coloured polyester trim that were on his feet looked almost new. &quot;I have you now!&quot; he stated with a voice like a crazed bull in a rainstorm. He grabbed Dwight Edgmont from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made motions of surprise with her hands.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity put her hands on her cheeks in shock.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where Captain Dwight is being held!&quot; intoned Tammy Smith irritatedly.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Captain Dwight is in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon,&quot; yelled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James annoyingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Quickly! We must make our way to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; bellowed Navigator Tammy irritatedly.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James picked up the bottle caps that were nearby. She held the bottle caps in her hand. &quot;These bottle caps represents how I feel inside,&quot; she raged sternly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, Nebulon appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;Nebulon!&quot; Ms. O'James screeched.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. &quot;So sorry to spoil your little party, do-gooders!&quot; he said with a voice like a rabid dog in a bazaar. He grabbed Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with him.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity shouted &quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot;. &quot;We must find out where that villian has taken Navigator Tammy!&quot; she bellowed enigmatically. &quot;I have a strong feeling Tammy Smith is in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon,&quot; she intoned annoyingly. &quot;Quickly! We must make our way to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; she shouted acidly. Walking along, she suddenly bonked her head against an invisible force field. &quot;There's no way we can get through this we'll have to find another way in!&quot; she droned drably. &quot;We have a duty to rescue Navigator Tammy Smith!&quot; she groaned weakly. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she groaned sadly.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been lost without you, Lieutenant Serenity,&quot; she smiled blissfully.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity surveyed the area. She all of a sudden had a intuition. She looked behind the nearby door to the dungeon. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; yelled Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James stated courageously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indebted to you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he said courageously. &quot;Thank you, Lieutenant Serenity,&quot; he sighed blissfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight smiled virtuously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage! His perfect brow in profile cast a shadow against the door to the dungeon.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been a goner without you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he drawled laughingly. &quot;I am in debt to you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; he whispered courageously. &quot;Thank you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he sighed calmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you'd expect. Some pulsing red and green lights seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Bees flew around.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some top notch thinking from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; drawled Dwight Edgmont enigmatically. He was sporting a handsome navy blue leather jacket and some floral print nylon slacks with maroon stripes. Some handsome black cotton trainers graced his feet. &quot;I think I should promote you to Lieutenant Commander, Serenity Starlight!&quot; he sighed blissfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Dwight Edgmont!&quot; sighed Serenity Starlight, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. She was decked out in an exquisite pale purple rayon jerkin adorned with sapphires and some WICKED AWESOME silver coloured crinkly foil leggings with midnight black rayon trim. The crimson crinkly foil dress shoes with crimson lightning bolt patterns that were on her feet looked almost new. &quot;It's enough to know I'm fighting on the side of good!&quot;. &quot;I could really go for a hot dog after that,&quot; she whispered fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; smiled Joe Mulbury blissfully.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; stated Captain Dwight courageously.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Tammy Smith. &quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Captain Dwight,&quot; she chirped firmly.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="8"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-star-jewel-of-eternity">9. The Star Jewel of Eternity</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. There was a communications panel off in the corner. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was standing near the navigation dashboard. She was looking delightful in a fantastic pale purple denim dress adorned with rubies. On her feet she wore some beautiful pale purple dacron sandals adorned with gems. Her wicked cute forehead in profile threw a shadow on the navigation dashboard.</p>
<p>&quot;I have just come back from the kitchen and it looks like we are fresh out of Space Sugar,&quot; breathed Commander Joe Mulbury energetically. The fine red denim suit jacket he was looking smashing in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. The fine silver coloured crinkly foil dress shoes on his feet seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. &quot;Hello, Ms. O'James,&quot; he stated fawningly. His perfect brow seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the communications panel. &quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight,&quot; he giggled happily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was intently cleaning the Star Jewel of Eternity. She was wearing a tacky black polyester suit jacket and a blue green crinkly foil skirt. Her feet were shod with some tasteless navy blue polyester pixie boots.</p>
<p>&quot;That Star Jewel of Eternity, it's pretty special, isn't it?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Fighters Command doesn't entrust us with just any old thing, Commander Joe,&quot; Tammy Smith chirped enigmatically. Her narrow mouth in profile cast a shadow against the view screen.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a surveillance drone buzzed by Captain Dwight Edgmont's head. He was looking ready for action in a fine silver coloured cotton track suit. On his feet he wore some orange red nylon trainers. His short black hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. &quot;What in blazes was that?&quot; he said enigmatically. He beamed enigmatically.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared! The red dacron tank top she was looking villanous in seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. The fine deep red dacron pixie boots with black cotton trim that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; barked Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled disdainfully. &quot;What have we here!&quot; she chirped with a voice like a hurricane in a snowstorm. She grabbed Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made gestures of disbelief with her arms.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont clapped his hands on his cheeks in surprise.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight yelled &quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where Joe Mulbury is being held!&quot; intoned Navigator Tammy gratingly.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Commander Joe is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; yelled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James menacingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; bellowed Tammy Smith irritatedly.</p>
<p>With a smooth yet firm motion, Lieutenant Serenity picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; she groaned firmly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a courier drone whizzed past Navigator Tammy Smith's head. &quot;What was that?&quot; she bellowed strongly. She frowned enigmatically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you'd expect. Nearby were some manacles. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; droned Lieutenant Serenity drily. She was looking delightful in a beautiful purple and gold leather robe with pale purple moon beam patterns. The marvellous shiny silver denim trainers with blue and purple cotton trim she was looking fine in seemed to glow in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>With a exquisite yet strong motion, Captain Dwight opened up the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro metrics look normal,&quot; chirped Captain Dwight obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a DUMP!!&quot; muttered Lieutenant Serenity exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Walking along, Navigator Tammy unexpectedly smacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>&quot;What in blazes was that?&quot; said Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James sadly. Walking along, she surprisedly whacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no way we can get through this we'll have to find another way in!&quot; intoned Tammy Smith slowly. She was looking completely unimpressive in a pink nylon tank top and some navy blue crinkly foil leggings. Some maroon rayon pixie boots graced her feet. &quot;We have a duty to rescue Commander Joe Mulbury!&quot; she groaned irksomely.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the rugged wastes of the planet Forbak.</p>
<hr />
<p>The wasteland was a sight to behold. A crumbling arch gleamed in the harsh sun light. A few Space Gnats buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the chills,&quot; said Lieutenant Serenity exasperatedly. She was looking delightful in a fantastic purple and gold cotton jersey with shimmering rainbow hued lightning bolt patterns and some beautiful pale violet nylon leggings with crimson and violet lacy frills. Her feet were shod in some marvellous pale violet crinkly foil sneakers with dark purple moon beam patterns.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont dialed up the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro readings look normal,&quot; giggled Captain Dwight enigmatically. He was looking exciting in a handsome maroon crinkly foil hoodie and some plaid cotton slacks. On his feet he wore some floral print leather dress shoes with brown stripes.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a DUMP!!&quot; intoned Ms. O'James weakly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy surveyed the area with her eyes. She was wearing a blue nylon hoodie and some tie dyed cotton culottes. The gold coloured denim shoes with a tacky white zig zag pattern that were on her feet looked almost new. She lifted the Star Jewel of Eternity. Without warning, she stubbed her toe. The Star Jewel of Eternity slipped out of her grip.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>A sour look crept across Navigator Tammy Smith's face.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont moved his graceful yet powerful arm in the direction of her.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James glanced grumpily at Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James spotted some Space Ferrets in the distance.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Ferrets!&quot; squeaked Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;Sdk tfgh yenaibex bdzzxqw!!!&quot; shouted the Space Ferrets in their strange Space Ferret language.</p>
<p>A harrowing battle had begun!</p>
<p>When the dust had settled, dazed Space Ferrets littered the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close call!&quot; intoned Tammy Smith irritatedly.</p>
<p>&quot;It looked like those Space Ferrets had The Skull Witch's insignia on their armor,&quot; stated Dwight Edgmont happily. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; intoned Navigator Tammy drably.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James looked around. She suddenly had a funny hunch. She looked behind the nearby sickly shrubs. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; shouted Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you'd expect. Some manacles seemed to dominate the environment. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight drawled calmly. She was looking delightful in some beautiful white denim coveralls with dark violet moon beam patterns. The elegant gold coloured polyester boots with frilly purple lace she was looking smashing in seemed to glow in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been a goner without you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he sighed firmly. He was looking impressive in a blue cotton jersey and some pinstripe polyester slacks with blue green stripes. Some mauve leather dress shoes with orange cotton trim were on his feet. &quot;Thank you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; he drawled calmly. &quot;I am indebted to you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; he stated enigmatically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. Nearby was a Captain's chair. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>&quot;You displayed some top notch action today, Lieutenant Serenity!&quot; smiled Dwight Edgmont blissfully. &quot;I think I should promote you to Lieutenant Commander, Lieutenant Serenity!&quot; he sighed laughingly. He was wearing a silver coloured dacron smock. His feet were shod in some fine black silk dress shoes.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Dwight Edgmont!&quot; blushed Lieutenant Serenity obsequiously. She was looking impressive in a blue and purple cotton halter top with shimmering purple dacron trim and some beautiful crimson and violet silk trousers with frilly shimmering multi hued lace. The elegant purple and white dacron dress shoes with indigo lacy frills that she had on looked almost new. &quot;I'm not in this for rank, I do it out of love!&quot;. &quot;I could really go for a parmo right now,&quot; she smiled laughingly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury flumped down on the couch. He was looking impressive in a blue green nylon top and some snappy navy blue polyester culottes. His feet were shod in some green cotton trainers.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; said Captain Dwight laughingly.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Navigator Tammy,&quot; smiled Captain Dwight firmly.</p>

<h2 id="the-return-of-the-space-slugs">10. The Return of The Space Slugs</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. There was a view screen off in the distance. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the communications panel. She was looking impressive in an exquisite purple and white denim blouse with frilly silver and purple lace and some exquisite black and purple nylon slacks with shimmering rainbow hued star patterns. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her perky shoulder length rainbow hued hair. The violet polyester trainers with pale purple leather trim on her feet seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the air conditioning unit. &quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he giggled with an enigmatic twitch of his mouth. He put his hand up to his perfect brow. He was looking delightful in a black nylon jerkin and some handsome pink polyester slacks. Some handsome red crinkly foil boots were on his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Commander Joe,&quot; giggled Captain Dwight Edgmont fawningly. He was sporting a red nylon robe. On his feet he wore some tan dacron sneakers. He put his hand up to his wide brow.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; chirped Navigator Tammy Smith with an enigmatic twitch of her nose.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was cracking open pecans with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;That Venusian Staff of Power, it's pretty special, isn't it?&quot; asked Tammy Smith. She was looking frumpy in a pink leather jacket and some blue dacron trousers with a tacky chartreuse zig zag pattern. Her shoulder length blonde hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. Her feet were shod in some floral print crinkly foil sneakers with a tacky tie dyed zig zag pattern.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the kind of thing you can just order on Omnizon, Navigator Tammy,&quot; Commander Joe whispered placidly.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a surveillance drone flew close by Navigator Tammy Smith's head. &quot;What in the world was that?&quot; she shouted annoyingly. She frowned emphatically.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared! Her scarred mouth seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. She was wearing a blood coloured polyester robe. On her feet she wore some deep red dacron sneakers.</p>
<p>&quot;The Skull Witch!&quot; Serenity Starlight yelled.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled maniacally. &quot;We meet again, kiddies!&quot; she stated with a voice like a baboon at a square dance. She snatched Dwight Edgmont from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith's mouth gaped wide in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;NOOO!&quot; barked Joe Mulbury with a voice like a giraffe driving a race car.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James made motions of surprise with her arms.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. With a smooth yet forceful motion, he lifted the cup of coffee. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; he raged viciously. Suddenly, a cooking drone flew close by his head. &quot;What the devil was that?&quot; he shouted irritatedly. He frowned menacingly. He looked around. He held the Venusian Staff of Power in his hand. Just then, he stumbled. He lost his grip on the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>The Venusian Staff of Power tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoopsy-daisy,&quot; gasped Joe Mulbury quietly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy moved her soft yet forceful arm in the direction of him.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James gestured towards Commander Joe. She surveyed the area. She all of a sudden had a unusual intuition. She looked behind the nearby Captain's chair. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; exclaimed Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the Nebulon's fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. A door to the dungeon seemed to dominate the environment. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; droned Navigator Tammy grumpily.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro metrics look normal,&quot; drawled Commander Joe, looking down at the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal.</p>
<p>&quot;... For a PIT!!&quot; mumbled Navigator Tammy drably.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury motioned Ms. O'James to step away from the others for a moment. He was looking smashing in a snappy floral print polyester jerkin with mauve stripes and some white dacron slacks. Some tie dyed cotton sneakers graced his feet. &quot;There's a thing I need to talk about&quot;, he groaned awkwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Ms. O'James. She was looking fine in an elegant purple denim robe with pale purple lacy frills. The exquisite pale indigo dacron trainers with pale indigo moon beam patterns that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, about that time in the mess hall...&quot; mumbled Joe Mulbury coyly.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James blushed a deep red. &quot;Speak not of it, Commander Joe&quot; she gulped slumblingly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe picked up the bottle caps that were nearby. He lifted the bottle caps. &quot;These bottle caps represents how I feel inside,&quot; he bleated grumpily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Slugs attacked Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>A intense battle commenced!</p>
<p>When the dust had cleared, dazed Space Slugs littered the area.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close one!&quot; muttered Tammy Smith outrageously. She was looking tastless in a pinstripe crinkly foil trench coat. Some white cotton pumps graced her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;It looked like those Space Slugs had The Skull Witch's insignia on their clothes,&quot; sighed Commander Joe courageously. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; mumbled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James exasperatedly. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she bleated sadly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage! He was looking ready for action in a snappy tie dyed silk jacket and some fine chartreuse nylon leggings with orange stripes. The fine maroon nylon trainers he was sporting seemed to gleam in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indebted to you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he said peacefully. &quot;Thank you, Joe Mulbury,&quot; he sighed courageously. &quot;I would have been a goner without you, Ms. O'James,&quot; he breathed blissfully.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you'd expect. A communications panel gleamed in the fluorescent light. A few Space Gnats buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some top notch thinking from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; smiled Dwight Edgmont virtuously. He was wearing a floral print leather trench coat. On his feet he wore some handsome tan cotton shoes. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Commander, Ms. O'James!&quot; he said virtuously.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; smiled Ms. O'James, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. She was looking impressive in a marvellous purple polyester gown adorned with sapphires. Her feet were shod with some beautiful rainbow coloured denim shoes with midnight black moon beam patterns. &quot;I'm not in this for rank, I do it out of love!&quot;. &quot;I could really go for a curry right now,&quot; she sighed obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; giggled Joe Mulbury happily. He was decked out in a mauve polyester jumper and some fine yellow crinkly foil culottes. The navy blue leather sneakers that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont flumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; stated Tammy Smith firmly. She was looking frumpy in a red cotton blouse and some ill fitting purple leather trousers. Her feet were shod with some black denim trainers with a tacky purple zig zag pattern.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Venusian Staff of Power, Commander Joe,&quot; stated Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James strongly.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. A Captain's chair seemed to dominate the environment. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was standing near the Captain's chair. She was looking impressive in a shimmering multi hued silk jumper with multi coloured moon beam patterns and an elegant purple and white silk skirt with multi hued moon beam patterns. On her feet she wore some marvellous dark purple rayon shoes adorned with sapphires.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the navigation dashboard. He was sporting a tan dacron jumper and some fine yellow nylon culottes. Some handsome violet cotton dress shoes were on his feet. &quot;Hello, Lieutenant Serenity,&quot; he breathed with an enigmatic twitch of his nose. His perfect brow in profile threw a shadow on the communications panel.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the Captain's chair.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was standing near the navigation dashboard. The mauve rayon leotard with gaudy maroon polka dots she was looking completely unimpressive in seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. Her feet were shod with some plaid leather shoes. &quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; she chirped with an enigmatic twitch of her mouth.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;Nebulon!&quot; Captain Dwight cried.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. He was looking impressive in a deep red denim sweater with dark red denim trim and some blood coloured leather slacks. The handsome deep red nylon dress shoes that he had on looked almost new. His jutting chin seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. &quot;So sorry to spoil your party, kiddies!&quot; he breathed with a voice like a gorilla in a snowstorm. He snatched Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with him.</p>
<p>&quot;NOOO!&quot; screamed Navigator Tammy outrageously.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight made gestures of disbelief with his hands. He was looking exciting in a tie dyed denim jersey and some snappy brown cotton leggings. The purple silk sneakers on his feet seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's mouth gaped wide in surprise. Her wicked cute forehead in profile cast a shadow against the communications panel.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where that villian has taken Joe Mulbury!&quot; said Captain Dwight virtuously. His short black hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Joe Mulbury is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; barked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James drily.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; yelped Dwight Edgmont happily.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; she barked enigmatically.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a surveillance drone whizzed past Captain Dwight Edgmont's head. &quot;What in blazes was that?&quot; he stated virtuously. He whistled energetically.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! She put her hand up to her scarred mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; cried Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled evilly. She was gotten up in a midnight black denim suit jacket and some fine blood coloured rayon trousers with red stripes. Her feet were shod with some dark black polyester trainers. &quot;What have we here!&quot; she breathed with a voice like a tiger in a performance art piece. She grabbed Navigator Tammy from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with her.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; squealed Captain Dwight with a voice like a hurricane in a video arcade.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James yelled &quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot;.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. In the centre of the area were some manacles. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; gulped Navigator Tammy sadly. She was gotten up in a blue green crinkly foil track suit. Some brown cotton sandals with a tacky green zig zag pattern were on her feet.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Serenity opened up the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro metrics look normal,&quot; bellowed Ms. O'James acidly. She was looking impressive in an exquisite white nylon jersey with shimmering rainbow coloured moon beam patterns and some elegant deep violet cotton leggings with red and purple lacy frills. On her feet she wore some beautiful purple and violet cotton sneakers with pale violet moon beam patterns.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a DUMP!!&quot; droned Tammy Smith slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Dwight Edgmont breathed lightly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; she stated calmly. &quot;I would have been lost without you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; she breathed strongly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight picked up the skull of a Space Rat that was nearby. He was looking exciting in some snappy blue leather coveralls. The fine tie dyed silk sandals on his feet seemed to glow in the dim torch light. He held the skull of a Space Rat in his hand. &quot;This skull of a Space Rat represents how I feel inside,&quot; he drawled happily. This was bad, but he didn't let it get him down.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Badgers came around the corner.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Badgers!&quot; hissed Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Uexj jhlktmj spnzu!!!&quot; shouted the Space Badgers in their strange Space Badger language.</p>
<p>A intense skirmish began!</p>
<p>&quot;BY THE RINGS OF MARS!!!&quot; bellowed Ms. O'James. She drew the Venusian Katana of Power out of her equipment bag. She lifted the Venusian Katana of Power above her head. She brought down the Venusian Katana of Power with a awesome power.</p>
<p>The Venusian Katana of Power made contact with the Space Badgers with a tremendous impact.</p>
<p>The Space Badgers went flying across the room.</p>
<p>&quot;BY THE RINGS OF VENUS!!!&quot; squealed Dwight Edgmont. He drew the vibro sword out of his backpack. He heaved the vibro sword over his head. He brought down the vibro sword with a awesome force.</p>
<p>The vibro sword made contact with the Space Badgers with a awesome whack.</p>
<p>The Space Badgers went flying across the room. When the dust had cleared, dazed Space Badgers were strewn across the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close one!&quot; smiled Captain Dwight fawningly. &quot;It looked like those Space Badgers had The Skull Witch's insignia on their jerseys,&quot; he whispered calmly. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; mumbled Serenity Starlight enigmatically.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Dwight Edgmont smiled happily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in debt to you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he drawled obsequiously. &quot;Thank you, Captain Dwight,&quot; he drawled firmly. He was looking delightful in an orange red denim jumpsuit. The silver coloured rayon dress shoes that were on his feet looked almost new. &quot;I would have been a goner without you, Ms. O'James,&quot; he giggled placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you'd expect. There was a communications panel off in the distance. A few Space Mosquitoes buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;That was some ace thinking from you today, Serenity Starlight!&quot; sighed Captain Dwight peacefully. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Lieutenant Commander, Ms. O'James!&quot; he chirped peacefully. He was sporting a pink polyester jumper and some mauve nylon trousers. The gold coloured cotton sneakers with blue stripes he was sporting seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; breathed Serenity Starlight energetically. She was looking impressive in a WICKED AWESOME purple and violet crinkly foil gown adorned with sapphires. Her feet were shod in some shiny purple polyester trainers with indigo lightning bolt patterns. &quot;It's enough to know I'm fighting on the side of good!&quot;. With a exquisite yet firm motion, she slumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>Commander Joe slumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; whispered Captain Dwight fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a hamburger after that,&quot; drawled Tammy Smith obsequiously. She was looking completely unimpressive in a bleak violet silk frock and a tasteless chartreuse dacron skirt with gaudy yellow polka dots. The gaudy mauve silk sneakers she was wearing seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="11"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-scourge-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">12. The Scourge of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. A navigation dashboard gleamed in the fluorescent light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the view screen. She was looking delightful in a marvellous purple and white dacron jersey with frilly silvery lace and an exquisite shiny silver leather skirt with pale indigo moon beam patterns. The beautiful dark indigo leather shoes with purple and violet moon beam patterns that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the air conditioning unit. He was sporting a floral print silk smock. His feet were shod with some tie dyed crinkly foil sneakers. &quot;Hello, Commander Joe Mulbury,&quot; he said with an enigmatic twitch of his ears.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; sighed Navigator Tammy Smith blissfully. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her shoulder length blonde locks. She was looking frumpy in a pink rayon jumper and some ill fitting violet dacron trousers with gaudy tie dyed polka dots. On her feet she wore some red rayon sandals with a tacky floral print zig zag pattern.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity was cracking open walnuts with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;That Saturnian Orb of Hope, it's kind of special, isn't it?&quot; asked Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;It means a lot to all of us, Tammy Smith,&quot; Serenity Starlight smiled calmly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared! Her long green hair seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; yelled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled disdainfully. She was gotten up in a snappy dark black silk jerkin and some fine dark red polyester slacks with red nylon trim. The snappy deep red leather pumps that were on her feet looked almost new. &quot;I have you now!&quot; she breathed with a voice like charcoal in a jewellery store. She grabbed Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy put her hands on her cheeks in shock.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont squealed &quot;OH NO!&quot;.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James made motions of surprise with her arms.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. With a smooth yet masterful motion, she lifted the cup of coffee. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; she bellowed threateningly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a delivery drone flew close by Captain Dwight Edgmont's head. &quot;What the devil was that?&quot; he breathed courageously. He beamed strongly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;Nebulon!&quot; Navigator Tammy yelled.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wildly. His jutting chin in profile threw a shadow on the pulsing red and green lights. He was wearing a blood red leather jacket and some blood coloured denim leggings. Some fine dark black dacron shoes were on his feet. &quot;We meet again, kiddies!&quot; he giggled with a voice like a rabid dog in a pet shop. He snatched Dwight Edgmont from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with him.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; shouted Navigator Tammy with a voice like an elephant in a video arcade.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James put her hands on her cheeks in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where Captain Dwight is being held!&quot; muttered Navigator Tammy outrageously.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Captain Dwight is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; groaned Serenity Starlight heavily.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; shouted Tammy Smith enigmatically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you'd expect. There were some manacles off in the distance. A few Space Bees buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the willies,&quot; muttered Tammy Smith downheartedly. She was looking completely unimpressive in a brown denim shirt and a tasteless gold coloured leather skirt. On her feet she wore some bleak silver coloured cotton boots.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James started the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro measurements look normal,&quot; muttered Lieutenant Commander Serenity menacingly. She was looking delightful in a fantastic silvery cotton leotard with deep indigo star patterns. Her feet were shod with some exquisite shimmering rainbow hued dacron dress shoes with gold coloured lacy frills.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, yeah... for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!&quot; intoned Tammy Smith exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James looked around. She lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope to eye level. All of a sudden, she was distracted. She lost her grip on the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoops,&quot; sighed Ms. O'James quietly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy looked at her.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity surveyed the area with her eyes. The dim torch light of the stronghold fortress of Nebulon cast highlights on her perky shoulder length rainbow hued hair. She suddenly had a hunch. She looked behind the nearby manacles. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; cried Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James whispered fawningly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage! He was wearing a yellow denim jacket and some yellow cotton trousers. His feet were shod with some green denim trainers.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indebted to you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he drawled happily. His wide brow seemed to shine in the dim torch light. &quot;I would have been a goner without you, Ms. O'James,&quot; he giggled placidly.</p>
<p>Walking along, Tammy Smith surprisedly whacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>&quot;What the devil was that?&quot; smiled Captain Dwight lightly. Walking along, he surprisedly smacked his head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no way we can get through this we'll have to find another way in!&quot; mumbled Navigator Tammy unhappily. &quot;We have a duty to rescue Commander Joe Mulbury!&quot; she gulped drily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the rugged wastes of the planet Forbak.</p>
<hr />
<p>The wasteland was a sight to behold. In the centre of the area was a crumbling arch. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; said Serenity Starlight irksomely. She was looking delightful in a beautiful pale indigo cotton hoodie with purple moon beam patterns and an elegant shiny purple polyester skirt with frilly shimmering rainbow coloured lace. The WICKED AWESOME white polyester pumps with shimmering rainbow hued star patterns on her feet seemed to glow in the harsh sun light.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro measurements look normal,&quot; giggled Dwight Edgmont, gazing down at his hyper crystal's enviro probe app. He was looking ready for action in an orange rayon long coat. On his feet he wore some red nylon sandals.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a DISASTER AREA!!&quot; mumbled Ms. O'James drably.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;It's The Skull Witch!&quot; Lieutenant Commander Serenity bellowed.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wickedly. She was looking menacing in a fine midnight black crinkly foil smock. Some handsome red denim boots with red rayon trim graced her feet. &quot;So sorry to spoil your little party, chums!&quot; she drawled with a voice like a gangster in a jewellery store. She grabbed Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont's mouth gaped wide in shock.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's mouth gawped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where that villian has taken Navigator Tammy!&quot; sighed Dwight Edgmont fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Tammy Smith is in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon,&quot; shouted Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James outrageously.</p>
<p>&quot;Quickly! We must make our way to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; exclaimed Captain Dwight laughingly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James picked up the vulture egg that was nearby. She held the vulture egg in her hand. &quot;This vulture egg represents how I feel inside,&quot; she raged acidly.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. Some manacles seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>&quot;What was that noise?&quot; said Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James. The marvellous purple and gold dacron shirt with shimmering multi hued lacy frills she was looking smashing in seemed to glow in the dim torch light. The elegant crimson silk trainers with pale indigo nylon trim she was looking impressive in seemed to gleam in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont just stared, seemingly paralyzed. He was sporting a snappy navy blue nylon jacket with gold coloured dacron trim and some purple silk slacks. The blue green polyester boots that he had on looked almost new. He was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity made gestures of disbelief with her arms.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James were attacked by some Space Otters.</p>
<p>A harrowing battle started!</p>
<p>When the dust had cleared, dazed Space Otters littered the area.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close one!&quot; splurted Ms. O'James menacingly. &quot;It looked like those Space Otters had The Skull Witch's insignia on their armor,&quot; she stated obsequiously. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;. &quot;There's no time to lose!&quot; she exclaimed. She helped dig Captain Dwight out from the rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Ms. O'James,&quot; said Dwight Edgmont enigmatically.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James spotted some Space Ferrets in the distance.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh oh, looks like we've got company,&quot; stated Serenity Starlight happily.</p>
<p>&quot;Hcophoht nygd vejlrq nyzpcp iwmrssj revxhvq swnamall sxbqblav des!!!&quot; shouted the Space Ferrets in their strange Space Ferret language.</p>
<p>A epic skirmish commenced!</p>
<p>When the dust had settled, dazed Space Ferrets littered the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close call!&quot; giggled Captain Dwight placidly.</p>
<p>&quot;It looked like those Space Ferrets had The Skull Witch's insignia on their uniforms,&quot; stated Lieutenant Commander Serenity enigmatically. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Captain Dwight giggled happily.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage! She was looking completely unimpressive in an orange rayon halter top and some yellow nylon culottes. Some tie dyed silk shoes were on her feet.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indebted to you, Captain Dwight,&quot; she breathed peacefully. &quot;Thank you, Ms. O'James,&quot; she breathed obsequiously. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she giggled strongly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage! He was decked out in a pink silk shirt and some fine green cotton culottes with chartreuse stripes. His feet were shod with some red silk shoes.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indebted to you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he chirped placidly. &quot;I would have been toast without you, Captain Dwight,&quot; he drawled fawningly. &quot;I would have been lost without you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he stated obsequiously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. In the centre of the area was a Captain's chair. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;That was some top notch action I saw from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; sighed Dwight Edgmont blissfully. &quot;I think I should promote you to Commander, Serenity Starlight!&quot; he giggled calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Dwight Edgmont!&quot; blushed Lieutenant Commander Serenity calmly. She was sporting an exquisite silvery crinkly foil long coat with crimson and purple lacy frills. The fantastic blue and purple denim sneakers with gold coloured polyester trim that were on her feet looked almost new. &quot;It's enough to know I'm fighting on the side of good!&quot;. She flumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a hamburger right now,&quot; giggled Joe Mulbury strongly. He was sporting a fine red dacron long coat. On his feet he wore some handsome violet crinkly foil dress shoes. He put his hand up to his perfect brow.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; said Captain Dwight courageously. He was resplendent in a navy blue crinkly foil shirt and some blue green crinkly foil slacks. On his feet he wore some plaid cotton trainers with floral print cotton trim.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith flumped down on the bean bag chair. She was gotten up in an orange red dacron top and some ill fitting navy blue nylon leggings. The blue green denim trainers that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; whispered Dwight Edgmont lightly.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="12"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-skull-witch">13. The Skull Witch</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you'd expect. An air conditioning unit gleamed in the fluorescent light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;I have just come back from the pantry and it looks like we are plum out of Space Sugar,&quot; smiled Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James virtuously. She was sporting a marvellous shiny silver dacron frock adorned with rubies and a fantastic purple and gold crinkly foil skirt with deep indigo star patterns. Her wicked cute forehead in profile cast a shadow against the communications panel. Her feet were shod with some red and purple cotton pumps adorned with jewels.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the view screen. &quot;Hello, Lieutenant Commander Serenity,&quot; he chirped with an enigmatic twitch of his nose.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Captain Dwight,&quot; said Navigator Tammy Smith blissfully. Her narrow mouth in profile cast a shadow against the air conditioning unit. She was looking tastless in an orange silk suit jacket and an outdated white denim skirt. Some pink cotton trainers graced her feet.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was studiously cleaning the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;That Saturnian Orb of Hope means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Dwight Edgmont. He was looking ready for action in a yellow denim jacket and some handsome violet dacron leggings. On his feet he wore some silver coloured silk dress shoes. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his short black locks.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the kind of thing you can just order from Omnizon, Captain Dwight,&quot; Serenity Starlight said fawningly. She gestured to Commander Joe Mulbury to step back from the others for a moment. &quot;There's something I wanted to talk about&quot;, she breathed enigmatically.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Serenity Starlight?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury. He was looking fine in a plaid cotton track suit. The pinstripe nylon boots that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, about that time in the loading bay...&quot; whispered Serenity Starlight slowly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe blushed a deep red. &quot;Hush, Lieutenant Commander Serenity, there's no need, you know that,&quot; he gasped slowly. His long auburn hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. Suddenly, a messenger drone whizzed past his head. &quot;What in Sam Hill was that?&quot; he yelled exasperatedly. He frowned irritatedly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared! She was looking impressive in a deep red denim great coat. Her scarred mouth seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. Some dark black cotton dress shoes were on her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; bellowed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wickedly. &quot;What have we here!&quot; she smiled with a voice like an elephant in a rainstorm. She snatched Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with her.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith clapped her hands on her cheeks in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;NOOO!&quot; yelped Dwight Edgmont placidly.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James barked &quot;OH NO!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where Commander Joe is being held!&quot; groaned Navigator Tammy viciously.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Commander Joe is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; shouted Serenity Starlight strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; barked Navigator Tammy impatiently.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. With a graceful yet forceful motion, she lifted the electro wrench. &quot;This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,&quot; she said irritatedly.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you'd expect. There was a torch in a thing on the wall off in the corner. A few Space Bees buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; mumbled Ms. O'James grumpily. The WICKED AWESOME deep indigo nylon top with pale violet lacy frills she was looking fine in seemed to shine in the dim torch light. Her feet were shod with some exquisite shimmering rainbow coloured silk trainers with pale purple lightning bolt patterns.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro measurements look normal,&quot; raged Navigator Tammy, looking down at the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a DISASTER AREA!!&quot; intoned Lieutenant Commander Serenity exasperatedly. She looked around. She held the Saturnian Orb of Hope in her hand. Without warning, she stubbed her toe. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of her hand.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoops,&quot; gulped Ms. O'James quietly.</p>
<p>With a supple yet powerful motion, Tammy Smith gestured towards her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight glanced calmly at Lieutenant Commander Serenity. He was sporting a black rayon suit jacket and some mauve nylon trousers with maroon stripes. Some yellow cotton dress shoes graced his feet.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont gritted his teeth and determined to stay optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; screeched Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled despicably. &quot;I have you now!&quot; she whispered with a voice like a tiger in a jewellery store. She snatched Dwight Edgmont from behind. The fine deep black cotton jersey she was wearing seemed to glow in the dim torch light. Her feet were shod with some snappy dark black crinkly foil pumps. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith's mouth gaped wide in shock. She was wearing an orange cotton frock and some yellow leather trousers. On her feet she wore some tacky silver coloured nylon trainers.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James clapped her hands to her cheeks in disbelief. She surveyed the area with her eyes. She suddenly had a unusual hunch. She looked behind the nearby puddle of icky looking liquid. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; yelped Tammy Smith. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she sighed firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in debt to you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he sighed strongly. &quot;Thank you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he sighed placidly. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; he whispered placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage! He was sporting a red silk jacket and some mauve dacron culottes with chartreuse crinkly foil trim. The tan denim shoes that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he giggled laughingly. &quot;I would have been a goner without you, Captain Dwight,&quot; he stated courageously. &quot;I am indebted to you, Lieutenant Commander Serenity,&quot; he smiled happily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. There was a navigation dashboard off in the distance. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some quick action from you today, Lieutenant Commander Serenity!&quot; whispered Captain Dwight placidly. The snappy blue denim robe he was sporting seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. The handsome gold coloured polyester boots that were on his feet looked almost new. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Commander, Lieutenant Commander Serenity!&quot; he drawled blissfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; sighed Serenity Starlight, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. She was decked out in a marvellous shimmering multi hued polyester great coat with rainbow hued moon beam patterns. Her feet were shod with some multi coloured denim trainers with frilly deep violet lace. &quot;I'm not in this for rank, I do it out of love!&quot;. &quot;I could really go for a hot dog right now,&quot; she chirped firmly.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Joe Mulbury. He was looking impressive in an orange polyester jerkin and some chartreuse dacron trousers. Some fine plaid dacron boots with gold coloured rayon trim graced his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; chirped Captain Dwight virtuously.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; breathed Navigator Tammy enigmatically. She was gotten up in a maroon crinkly foil jumper and a pink nylon skirt. The outdated orange silk sneakers on her feet seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Serenity Starlight,&quot; smiled Captain Dwight strongly.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="13"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-menace-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">14. The Menace of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. A view screen gleamed in the fluorescent light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was standing near the pulsing red and green lights. She was looking fine in an elegant shiny silver silk top adorned with gems and some beautiful deep violet polyester leggings adorned with emeralds. Her wicked cute forehead in profile threw a shadow on the air conditioning unit. On her feet she wore some beautiful midnight black cotton dress shoes with deep indigo star patterns.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the view screen. &quot;Hello, Ms. O'James,&quot; he whispered with an enigmatic twitch of his mouth. He put his hand up to his perfect brow. He was decked out in a green polyester muscle shirt and some navy blue silk culottes. On his feet he wore some fine tie dyed silk trainers.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the communications panel. He was looking exciting in a snappy purple silk jacket and some yellow silk leggings. The white denim shoes that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James was cracking open walnuts with the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;That Chalice of Dreams means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Navigator Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Fighters Command doesn't entrust us with just any old thing, Tammy Smith,&quot; Ms. O'James said blissfully.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! She was looking impressive in a dark black cotton long coat. Her long green hair seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. The blood coloured leather pixie boots she was wearing seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>&quot;It's The Skull Witch!&quot; Tammy Smith screeched.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled maniacally. &quot;We meet again, do-gooders!&quot; she whispered with a voice like a hurricane at a baseball game. She snatched Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy screamed &quot;NOOO!&quot;. She was gotten up in a green polyester jumper and a gaudy blue denim skirt. The pink polyester pixie boots with gaudy white polka dots on her feet seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont made motions of disbelief with his hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; yelled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James with a voice like a gangster in a rainstorm.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight picked up the star charts that were nearby. He lifted the star charts into the light. &quot;These star charts represents how I feel inside,&quot; he smiled laughingly.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity surveyed the area with her eyes. She held the Chalice of Dreams in her hand. Without warning, she tripped. She lost her grip on the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>The Chalice of Dreams tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A sour look crept across Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's face.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith moved her supple yet forceful hand in the direction of her. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her shoulder length blonde locks.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont moved his soft yet strong hand in the direction of Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; yelled Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled maniacally. &quot;What have we here!&quot; she said with a voice like a tiger driving a race car. She snatched Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith's mouth gaped wide in surprise.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James made gestures of surprise with her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where that villian has taken Captain Dwight!&quot; splurted Navigator Tammy menacingly.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Dwight Edgmont is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; shouted Lieutenant Commander Serenity firmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; barked Navigator Tammy strongly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. Some manacles seemed to dominate the environment. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the willies,&quot; said Ms. O'James irksomely. She was decked out in a crimson and violet dacron track suit with pale purple lacy frills. Some fantastic silvery silk boots with violet moon beam patterns graced her feet.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;Nebulon!&quot; Ms. O'James shouted.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wildly. His jutting chin seemed to glow in the dim torch light. &quot;So sorry to spoil your little party, kiddies!&quot; he smiled with a voice like a crazed bull in a video arcade. He was looking intimidating in a blood coloured cotton shirt with blood coloured stripes and some black cotton culottes. His feet were shod in some midnight black crinkly foil boots. He grabbed Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with him.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James clapped her hands to the sides of her face in surprise. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she raged threateningly.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage! The gold coloured silk hoodie with gaudy purple polka dots she was gotten up in seemed to glow in the dim torch light. On her feet she wore some black nylon pixie boots.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been a goner without you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; she chirped peacefully. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she stated laughingly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indebted to you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he breathed courageously. &quot;Thank you, Ms. O'James,&quot; he stated firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you'd expect. Not too far away were some pulsing red and green lights. A few Space Gnats flew around.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight looked around. She was looking smashing in a dark indigo nylon jerkin with indigo star patterns and some marvellous black and purple crinkly foil culottes with shimmering purple moon beam patterns. The elegant blue and purple dacron pixie boots adorned with rubies that were on her feet looked almost new. She all of a sudden had a unusual hunch. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; yelled Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. Nearby was a puddle of icky looking liquid. A few Space Gnats flew around.</p>
<p>Walking along, Navigator Tammy suddenly smacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>&quot;What in Sam Hill was that?&quot; drawled Dwight Edgmont placidly. Walking along, he surprisedly whacked his head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no way we can get through this we'll have to find another way in!&quot; intoned Tammy Smith sadly. &quot;We have a duty to rescue Commander Joe Mulbury!&quot; she said grumpily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the rugged wastes of the planet Forbak.</p>
<hr />
<p>The blasted surface of Forbak was a sight to behold. Some sickly shrubs gleamed in the harsh sun light. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the willies,&quot; mumbled Ms. O'James drably. She was looking delightful in a crimson denim shirt adorned with emeralds and some marvellous crimson and violet rayon trousers with midnight black denim trim. Her feet were shod with some elegant shimmering rainbow coloured rayon trainers with silver and purple lacy frills.</p>
<p>With a smooth yet forceful motion, Dwight Edgmont started the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro metrics look normal,&quot; whispered Captain Dwight lightly. He put his hand up to his wide brow.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, normal... for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!&quot; gasped Ms. O'James drably.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, Nebulon appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; yelled Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled maniacally. &quot;What have we here!&quot; he drawled with a voice like charcoal at a square dance. He grabbed Navigator Tammy from behind. He was wearing a blood red cotton top with midnight black leather trim and some blood coloured polyester slacks. Some fine black cotton boots were on his feet. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with him.</p>
<p>&quot;NOOO!&quot; yelled Captain Dwight with a voice like a ninja driving a race car. He was resplendent in a fine navy blue leather shirt and some green silk trousers. His feet were shod in some snappy red leather trainers with black stripes.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight shouted &quot;NOOO!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where that villian has taken Navigator Tammy!&quot; breathed Dwight Edgmont blissfully.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Navigator Tammy is in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon,&quot; shouted Ms. O'James acidly.</p>
<p>&quot;Quickly! We must make our way to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; squealed Captain Dwight calmly. He picked up the oddly shaped rock that was nearby. With a exquisite yet masterful motion, he lifted the oddly shaped rock to eye level. &quot;This oddly shaped rock represents how I feel inside,&quot; he breathed lightly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. A door to the dungeon seemed to dominate the environment. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James spotted some Space Wallabies in the distance.</p>
<p>&quot;Looks like they've found us,&quot; breathed Captain Dwight happily. He was sporting a fine yellow cotton jersey and some red silk slacks with yellow stripes. The tan nylon sneakers with silver coloured polyester trim that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Wjuq aynmgc fkapdyqg jqsbtdf qezscy!!!&quot; shouted the Space Wallabies in their weird Space Wallabie language.</p>
<p>A epic battle commenced!</p>
<p>&quot;BY THE RINGS OF VENUS!!!&quot; yelped Captain Dwight. He drew the vibro sword out of his backpack. He raised the vibro sword above his head. He brought down the vibro sword with a awesome movement.</p>
<p>The vibro sword made contact with the Space Wallabies with a mighty thud.</p>
<p>The Space Wallabies went flying across the room. When the dust had cleared, dazed Space Wallabies littered the area.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close call!&quot; smiled Dwight Edgmont obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;It looked like those Space Wallabies had Nebulon the Dastardly's insignia on their armor,&quot; whispered Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James virtuously. She was looking smashing in an elegant shiny silver dacron halter top with blue and purple polyester trim and a marvellous crimson crinkly foil skirt with purple and gold moon beam patterns. Some fantastic gold coloured polyester pumps with silvery lacy frills were on her feet. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she said enigmatically.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage! She was wearing an ill fitting tan silk top and some red cotton culottes. On her feet she wore some brown nylon dress shoes.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been a goner without you, Captain Dwight,&quot; she chirped obsequiously. &quot;Thank you, Ms. O'James,&quot; she giggled enigmatically.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James giggled calmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage! He was sporting some tan nylon coveralls. On his feet he wore some silver coloured nylon dress shoes.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in debt to you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he sighed lightly. &quot;I would have been toast without you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; he chirped peacefully. &quot;I am indebted to you, Lieutenant Commander Serenity,&quot; he whispered lightly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you'd expect. There was an air conditioning unit off in the corner. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw you display some quick thinking today, Serenity Starlight!&quot; sighed Dwight Edgmont blissfully. The red nylon sweater with gold coloured stripes he was resplendent in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. Some fine plaid crinkly foil boots with gold coloured leather trim graced his feet. &quot;I think I should promote you to Commander, Serenity Starlight!&quot; he drawled peacefully.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Dwight Edgmont!&quot; blushed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James peacefully. She was decked out in an elegant pale indigo leather jacket with purple rayon trim and some marvellous red and purple rayon slacks adorned with emeralds. The fantastic blue and purple leather dress shoes with pale purple moon beam patterns that she had on looked almost new. &quot;I'm too modest, I like being a Lieutenant Commander too!&quot;. She flumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a pizza after that,&quot; stated Joe Mulbury peacefully.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; stated Tammy Smith fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Chalice of Dreams, Serenity Starlight,&quot; drawled Joe Mulbury placidly. He was looking delightful in a snappy blue green nylon shirt with orange red rayon trim and some mauve rayon slacks. His feet were shod in some blue green silk shoes.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="14"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-space-ostriches">15. The Space Ostriches</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. There was a navigation dashboard off in the distance. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was standing near the Captain's chair. She was looking delightful in a gold coloured dacron smock with rainbow hued lightning bolt patterns. Some exquisite purple dacron boots with silver coloured moon beam patterns were on her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; said Commander Joe Mulbury happily. He was decked out in a handsome silver coloured crinkly foil smock. The tie dyed rayon trainers that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the air conditioning unit. &quot;Hello, Lieutenant Commander Serenity,&quot; he drawled with an enigmatic twitch of his mouth. He was wearing a silver coloured rayon jumpsuit with plaid stripes. On his feet he wore some silver coloured denim shoes with yellow nylon trim. His wide brow in profile cast a shadow against the view screen.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the navigation dashboard. She was wearing a brown dacron blouse and some tacky gold coloured denim trousers. Her narrow mouth in profile threw a shadow on the air conditioning unit. Her feet were shod in some green dacron shoes.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James was intently cleaning the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;That Chalice of Dreams, it's pretty special, isn't it?&quot; asked Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;It means a lot to all of us, Navigator Tammy,&quot; Serenity Starlight breathed energetically.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was cracking open walnuts with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;That Venusian Staff of Power, it's pretty special, isn't it?&quot; asked Commander Joe. His perfect brow in profile cast a shadow against the view screen.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the sort of thing you can just order on Omnizon, Commander Joe,&quot; Captain Dwight breathed placidly.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James gestured to Joe Mulbury to step away from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I wanted to say to you&quot;, she began awkwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Ms. O'James?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, about the other day in the mess hall...&quot; whispered Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James carefully. Her perky shoulder length rainbow hued hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe went beet red with blushing. He held his finger up to Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's lips.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was looking intimidating in a handsome dark black nylon shirt and some blood red crinkly foil trousers. On his feet he wore some blood coloured nylon dress shoes.</p>
<p>&quot;Nebulon!&quot; Dwight Edgmont exclaimed.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled hatefully. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his close cropped green locks. &quot;I have you now!&quot; he said with a voice like a gorilla at a square dance. He snatched Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith's mouth gaped wide in surprise.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight cried &quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot;.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity clapped her hands on her cheeks in disbelief.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. He held the electro wrench in his hand. &quot;This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,&quot; he sighed fawningly. Out of the blue, a delivery drone whizzed past his head. &quot;What in Sam Hill was that?&quot; he smiled strongly. He winked strongly. He surveyed the area with his eyes. He lifted the Venusian Staff of Power to eye level. Just then, he lost his balance. He lost his grip on the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>The Venusian Staff of Power tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh-oh,&quot; giggled Dwight Edgmont quietly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy pointed towards him.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James moved her gentle yet confident arm in the direction of Dwight Edgmont. She looked around. She all of a sudden had a strange intuition. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; yelled Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the Nebulon's fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you'd expect. A puddle of icky looking liquid gleamed in the dim torch light. A few Space Bees flew around.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; mumbled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James drily. She was looking delightful in an elegant purple and violet denim jacket with crimson and violet lightning bolt patterns and some marvellous dark violet crinkly foil trousers with deep indigo polyester trim. Her feet were shod in some dark indigo polyester pumps with frilly rainbow hued lace.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro readings look normal,&quot; whispered Tammy Smith, peering down at her hyper crystal's enviro probe app.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, yeah... for a PIT!!&quot; bleated Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James weakly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, Nebulon appeared! He was gotten up in a midnight black polyester shirt and some midnight black denim leggings. Some red polyester sneakers were on his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Nebulon!&quot; Tammy Smith screeched.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled hatefully. &quot;So sorry to spoil your party, kiddies!&quot; he drawled with a voice like a ninja in a snowstorm. He grabbed Dwight Edgmont from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with him.</p>
<p>&quot;NOOO!&quot; shouted Tammy Smith gratingly.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity made motions of surprise with her hands.</p>
<p>With a exquisite yet masterful motion, Navigator Tammy picked up the skull of a Space Rat that was nearby. She held the skull of a Space Rat in her hand. She was looking frumpy in a tacky purple leather jumpsuit with a tacky silver coloured zig zag pattern. The pink crinkly foil dress shoes that she had on looked almost new. &quot;This skull of a Space Rat represents how I feel inside,&quot; she intoned sternly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Ostriches came around the corner.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Ostriches!&quot; hissed Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>&quot;Bekcw debis hveyjre iqpnmjwm ajix!!!&quot; shouted the Space Ostriches in their strange Space Ostriche language.</p>
<p>A epic skirmish ensued!</p>
<p>When the dust had cleared, dazed Space Ostriches littered the area.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close one!&quot; shouted Navigator Tammy heavily. &quot;It looked like those Space Ostriches had The Skull Witch's insignia on their jerseys,&quot; she whispered placidly. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; droned Lieutenant Commander Serenity weakly. She looked around. She held the Chalice of Dreams in her hand. Just then, she lost her balance. The Chalice of Dreams slipped out of her hand.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>A crestfallen look crept across Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's face.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith glared in the direction of her.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Nebulon appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; yelled Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled maniacally. &quot;We meet again, do-gooders!&quot; he drawled with a voice like a samurai at a square dance. He grabbed Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with him.</p>
<p>&quot;OH NO!&quot; screeched Serenity Starlight with a voice like an elephant driving a race car. She surveyed the area. She suddenly had a funny hunch. She looked behind the nearby door to the dungeon. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; yelled Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight whispered peacefully.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Ms. O'James,&quot; she said peacefully. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she whispered placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage! He was looking exciting in a fine violet rayon muscle shirt with pink cotton trim and some chartreuse dacron culottes with floral print rayon trim. On his feet he wore some navy blue denim boots.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in debt to you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he whispered blissfully. &quot;Thank you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; he sighed virtuously.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight chirped lightly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage! He was looking smashing in a purple polyester trench coat. The silver coloured silk sandals that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been lost without you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he giggled calmly. &quot;I would have been lost without you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; he giggled courageously. &quot;I am indebted to you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he smiled calmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. An air conditioning unit seemed to dominate the environment. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw you display some top notch action today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; said Captain Dwight laughingly. He was wearing a pinstripe nylon suit jacket and some snappy tie dyed cotton culottes. Some tan polyester boots with floral print stripes were on his feet. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Commander, Lieutenant Commander Serenity!&quot; he stated happily.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Dwight Edgmont!&quot; giggled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James, blushing fiercely like a tiger. She was sporting a shiny purple polyester jumper adorned with sapphires and some marvellous black and purple denim leggings with rainbow hued lightning bolt patterns. Her feet were shod in some elegant dark purple crinkly foil boots with purple crinkly foil trim. &quot;I'm not in this for rank, I do it out of love!&quot;. &quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; she smiled energetically.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; breathed Joe Mulbury enigmatically. He was wearing some maroon cotton coveralls. On his feet he wore some snappy orange red leather dress shoes.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; whispered Dwight Edgmont energetically.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a hot dog after that,&quot; drawled Tammy Smith strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Venusian Staff of Power, Captain Dwight,&quot; sighed Commander Joe blissfully.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-secret-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">16. The Secret of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. Not too far away were some pulsing red and green lights. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the Captain's chair. She was looking impressive in an exquisite silvery nylon frock adorned with gems and an elegant black and purple nylon skirt with violet moon beam patterns. Her feet were shod in some elegant silvery rayon sandals with pale violet lacy frills.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was playing that new match three game on his hyper crystal. &quot;Hello, Lieutenant Commander Serenity,&quot; he said virtuously.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight,&quot; giggled Captain Dwight Edgmont with an enigmatic twitch of his nose. His wide brow seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Joe Mulbury,&quot; smiled Navigator Tammy Smith virtuously. She was gotten up in a chartreuse rayon jerkin with a tacky tan zig zag pattern and some silver coloured nylon leggings. She put her hand up to her narrow mouth. The orange rayon dress shoes that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight motioned Commander Joe to step back from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I need to say to you&quot;, she began awkwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Serenity Starlight?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, about the other day in the loading bay...&quot; sighed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James slowly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe blushed a deep red. &quot;Hush, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James, there's no need, you know that,&quot; he gasped carefully. He was looking smashing in a snappy blue green nylon top and some silver coloured nylon slacks. Some chartreuse nylon trainers with white stripes graced his feet. From out of nowhere, a cooking drone buzzed by his head. His perfect brow in profile threw a shadow on the navigation dashboard. &quot;What in blazes was that?&quot; he shouted emphatically. He frowned exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; screeched Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. He was looking villanous in a midnight black dacron sweater and some snappy deep red polyester trousers with red stripes. The black leather trainers that he had on looked almost new. &quot;What have we here!&quot; he giggled with a voice like a hurricane in a rainstorm. He snatched Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with him.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith made gestures of shock with her hands.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont clapped his hands to the sides of his face in shock. He was sporting a tan nylon jumper and some snappy mauve leather culottes. His feet were shod in some navy blue cotton dress shoes.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James yelled &quot;OH NO!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where Commander Joe is being held!&quot; whispered Captain Dwight laughingly.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Joe Mulbury is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; splurted Lieutenant Commander Serenity icily.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; exclaimed Captain Dwight virtuously.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She lifted the cup of coffee to eye level. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; she raged icily.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you'd expect. There was a door to the dungeon off in the corner. A few Space Mosquitoes flew around.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the chills,&quot; droned Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James enigmatically. She was looking impressive in a beautiful deep indigo denim blouse with dark purple lacy frills and an elegant silver coloured cotton skirt with white nylon trim. Some fantastic silvery polyester pixie boots with indigo star patterns graced her feet. Her perky shoulder length rainbow hued hair seemed to gleam in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>With a supple yet confident motion, Captain Dwight launched the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro metrics look normal,&quot; stated Captain Dwight virtuously. The tan nylon suit jacket he was looking exciting in seemed to shine in the dim torch light. On his feet he wore some handsome blue dacron sandals.</p>
<p>&quot;... For a PIT!!&quot; mumbled Lieutenant Commander Serenity heavily.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, Nebulon appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;It's Nebulon!&quot; Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James barked.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled hatefully. He put his hand up to his jutting chin. &quot;We meet again, do-gooders!&quot; he sighed with a voice like a crazed bull in a gymnasium parking lot. He was looking impressive in a midnight black leather jerkin with red polyester trim and some blood coloured dacron culottes. His feet were shod in some deep black dacron trainers. He snatched Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with him.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont's mouth gawped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Serenity put her hands to the sides of her face in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where that villian has taken Tammy Smith!&quot; drawled Captain Dwight laughingly.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Tammy Smith is in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon,&quot; muttered Ms. O'James viciously.</p>
<p>&quot;Quickly! We must make our way to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; squealed Dwight Edgmont firmly.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>&quot;What was that noise?&quot; splurted Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>Too quickly for anyone to react, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Captain Dwight stood frozen like a deer in headlights. He was buried under rubble. He wasn't going to let a little thing like this get him down, though.</p>
<p>&quot;NOOO!&quot; gasped Serenity Starlight enigmatically. &quot;Hurry!&quot; she bleated. She helped dig Captain Dwight out from the rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Lieutenant Commander Serenity,&quot; stated Dwight Edgmont calmly. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; he whispered peacefully.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; she breathed happily. She was looking completely unimpressive in a chartreuse leather track suit. The pinstripe leather dress shoes with gaudy floral print polka dots that were on her feet looked almost new. &quot;I am in debt to you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; she said strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Dwight Edgmont said courageously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been lost without you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he said energetically. The snappy chartreuse crinkly foil sweater with red stripes he was looking impressive in seemed to glow in the dim torch light. On his feet he wore some blue green polyester trainers with violet stripes. &quot;Thank you, Captain Dwight,&quot; he said blissfully. &quot;I am in debt to you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he breathed obsequiously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Lieutenant Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. A navigation dashboard gleamed in the fluorescent light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;That was some quick thinking I saw from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; breathed Dwight Edgmont courageously. He was sporting a pinstripe leather jacket and some fine maroon polyester trousers. Some tan denim shoes graced his feet. &quot;I think I should promote you to Commander, Ms. O'James!&quot; he whispered happily.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; blushed Ms. O'James firmly. She was looking impressive in a beautiful dark violet dacron long coat with frilly deep violet lace. Her feet were shod with some beautiful shimmering purple denim sandals with midnight black crinkly foil trim. &quot;It's enough to know I'm fighting on the side of good!&quot;. &quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Commander Joe flumped down on the couch. He was looking impressive in a navy blue denim top and some red silk trousers. The handsome green denim trainers that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; giggled Tammy Smith enigmatically. The gaudy black nylon sweater with gaudy gold coloured polka dots she was gotten up in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. Some mauve silk pixie boots graced her feet.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="16"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-return-of-the-skull-witch">17. The Return of The Skull Witch</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. An air conditioning unit gleamed in the fluorescent light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the communications panel. She was wearing an elegant crimson and violet crinkly foil top with pale purple lacy frills and some beautiful shiny purple nylon culottes with silver coloured lightning bolt patterns. Her wicked cute forehead in profile cast a shadow against the view screen. Some crimson silk pixie boots with shimmering purple lightning bolt patterns graced her feet.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the air conditioning unit. &quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he drawled virtuously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was studiously buffing the Star Jewel of Eternity. Her narrow mouth seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. She was gotten up in a gaudy white silk top with gaudy gold coloured polka dots and some black silk slacks. The bleak orange red crinkly foil dress shoes that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;That Star Jewel of Eternity means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Commander Joe Mulbury. The blue denim shirt he was sporting seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. On his feet he wore some purple rayon boots.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Fighters Command doesn't entrust us with just any old thing, Commander Joe,&quot; Navigator Tammy stated enigmatically. She was intently buffing the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;That Saturnian Orb of Hope means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Captain Dwight. He was looking exciting in a snappy brown cotton shirt and some handsome silver coloured rayon slacks with tie dyed cotton trim. His feet were shod with some green silk dress shoes with blue nylon trim. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his short black locks.</p>
<p>&quot;It means a lot to all of us, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; Tammy Smith sighed happily.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight gestured to Joe Mulbury to step aside from the others for a moment. &quot;There's something I need to talk to you about&quot;, she said painfully.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Commander Serenity?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, about last night in the mess hall...&quot; mumbled Ms. O'James slowly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury blushed a deep red. &quot;It's all right, Serenity Starlight, you don't need to say anything,&quot; he gulped slowly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;It's Nebulon!&quot; Tammy Smith shouted.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. He was gotten up in a fine deep red nylon sweater and some dark red dacron slacks. He put his hand up to his jutting chin. The snappy deep black silk shoes with deep red stripes that were on his feet looked almost new. &quot;So sorry to spoil your little party, do-gooders!&quot; he said with a voice like an elephant at a square dance. He snatched Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith's mouth gaped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight made motions of disbelief with his hands.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James put her hands to her cheeks in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where Joe Mulbury is being held!&quot; said Tammy Smith enigmatically.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Commander Joe is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; muttered Ms. O'James exasperatedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; shouted Navigator Tammy outrageously.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. He held the electro wrench in his hand. &quot;This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,&quot; he whispered obsequiously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, Nebulon appeared!</p>
<p>This was bad, but Dwight Edgmont didn't let it get him down. &quot;It's Nebulon!&quot; he shouted.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled disdainfully. &quot;So sorry to spoil your little party, do-gooders!&quot; he sighed with a voice like a baboon at a monster truck rally. He grabbed Navigator Tammy from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with him.</p>
<p>&quot;OH NO!&quot; squealed Captain Dwight with a voice like a giraffe piloting a helicopter.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James bellowed &quot;NOOO!&quot;.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you'd expect. There was a puddle of icky looking liquid off in the corner. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; groaned Ms. O'James sadly. She was looking fine in a beautiful pale purple silk shirt with frilly shiny purple lace and some exquisite white rayon culottes with shiny purple silk trim. Her feet were shod with some shimmering rainbow coloured crinkly foil boots with shimmering rainbow coloured lacy frills.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith dialed up the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro metrics look normal,&quot; splurted Navigator Tammy drily.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!&quot; mumbled Serenity Starlight weakly. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she intoned irritatedly.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage! She was gotten up in a tasteless tie dyed rayon sweater and some tie dyed silk slacks. On her feet she wore some pinstripe crinkly foil dress shoes.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; she chirped courageously. &quot;Thank you, Commander Serenity,&quot; she chirped enigmatically. She looked around. She held the Saturnian Orb of Hope in her hand. Suddenly, she stubbed her toe. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of her grip.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>A sour look crept across Navigator Tammy Smith's face.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont gestured towards her. He was looking exciting in a tan cotton jersey and some snappy mauve nylon slacks with orange red stripes. The silver coloured silk boots he was looking exciting in seemed to shine in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James looked at Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; screamed Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled disdainfully. Her scarred mouth in profile cast a shadow against the manacles. She was looking menacing in a deep black polyester robe. Some snappy dark black polyester pixie boots were on her feet. &quot;I have you now!&quot; she whispered with a voice like a tiger in a bazaar. She snatched Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith's mouth gawped wide in shock.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity barked &quot;NOOO!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where that villian has taken Captain Dwight!&quot; barked Tammy Smith heavily.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Captain Dwight is in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon,&quot; groaned Serenity Starlight threateningly.</p>
<p>&quot;Quickly! We must make our way to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; shouted Tammy Smith exasperatedly. She surveyed the area. She lifted the Star Jewel of Eternity. All of a sudden, she stumbled. She lost her grip on the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>The Star Jewel of Eternity tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Drat,&quot; said Navigator Tammy quietly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight glared in the direction of her. She surveyed the area with her eyes. She suddenly had a funny inkling. She looked behind the nearby manacles. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; yelped Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James looked around. She suddenly had a odd hunch. She looked behind the nearby puddle of icky looking liquid. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; yelped Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Ms. O'James smiled placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in debt to you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he chirped enigmatically. &quot;I would have been toast without you, Ms. O'James,&quot; he sighed enigmatically.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Tammy Smith sighed virtuously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage! He was decked out in a snappy blue green crinkly foil smock. On his feet he wore some snappy pink crinkly foil trainers.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he sighed placidly. His long auburn hair seemed to shine in the dim torch light. &quot;I would have been a goner without you, Captain Dwight,&quot; he sighed fawningly. &quot;I am in debt to you, Ms. O'James,&quot; he drawled laughingly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. Nearby was a view screen. A few Space Mosquitoes buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some ace thinking I saw from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; smiled Captain Dwight fawningly. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Captain, Ms. O'James!&quot; he chirped strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; giggled Commander Serenity lightly. She was looking impressive in an elegant rainbow hued leather halter top with frilly violet lace and some exquisite rainbow hued crinkly foil slacks with shimmering rainbow hued lightning bolt patterns. Her feet were shod in some beautiful midnight black crinkly foil pumps with rainbow hued nylon trim. &quot;I'm not in this for rank, I do it out of love!&quot;. &quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a hot dog right now,&quot; whispered Commander Joe strongly. He was looking fine in a black rayon smock with red nylon trim. The fine green denim trainers that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; stated Dwight Edgmont peacefully.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith flumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Tammy Smith,&quot; whispered Captain Dwight fawningly.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="17"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-revenge-of-the-skull-witch">18. The Revenge of The Skull Witch</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you'd expect. There were some pulsing red and green lights off in the corner. A few Space Bees flew around.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was standing near the air conditioning unit. She was looking delightful in a dark purple dacron jumpsuit with black and purple lacy frills. Some beautiful shiny silver leather dress shoes with pale violet moon beam patterns were on her feet. Her wicked cute forehead in profile threw a shadow on the pulsing red and green lights.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the Captain's chair. He was looking smashing in a red dacron jumper and some yellow rayon leggings. Some floral print denim sneakers graced his feet. &quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he giggled with an enigmatic twitch of his ears. His long auburn hair seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the pulsing red and green lights. His wide brow in profile cast a shadow against the air conditioning unit. He was looking exciting in a handsome brown silk jerkin and some gold coloured nylon trousers with red stripes. His feet were shod with some navy blue silk boots.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Joe Mulbury,&quot; said Navigator Tammy Smith blissfully. She was looking completely unimpressive in a purple cotton smock. The pinstripe cotton sandals that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was cracking open walnuts with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;That Venusian Staff of Power, it's pretty special, isn't it?&quot; asked Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Fighters Command doesn't entrust us with just any old thing, Navigator Tammy,&quot; Joe Mulbury whispered laughingly.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was cracking open walnuts with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;That Saturnian Orb of Hope, it's kind of special, isn't it?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the sort of thing you can just order off Omnizon, Commander Joe,&quot; Captain Dwight drawled blissfully. He looked around. He lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope. Just then, he stubbed his toe. He lost his grip on the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoops,&quot; said Dwight Edgmont quietly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy moved her soft yet masterful hand in the direction of him. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her shoulder length blonde hair.</p>
<p>Commander Joe glanced downheartedly at Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James looked at Captain Dwight. Suddenly, a messenger drone buzzed by her head. &quot;What the devil was that?&quot; she intoned irritatedly. She blinked strongly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! She was looking villanous in a fine dark red leather blouse and some blood coloured crinkly foil leggings. On her feet she wore some midnight black nylon pumps with dark black leather trim.</p>
<p>&quot;It's The Skull Witch!&quot; Serenity Starlight shouted.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled despicably. &quot;What have we here!&quot; she said with a voice like a gangster in a snowstorm. She snatched Navigator Tammy from behind. Her scarred mouth seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with her.</p>
<p>Commander Joe clapped his hands on the sides of his face in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; cried Captain Dwight enigmatically.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight made motions of surprise with her hands.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont picked up the star charts that were nearby. He held the star charts in his hand. &quot;These star charts represents how I feel inside,&quot; he giggled strongly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury motioned Serenity Starlight to step back from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I need to talk to you about&quot;, he began painfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Commander Serenity.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, about that time in the loading bay...&quot; mumbled Joe Mulbury enigmatically.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James went beet red with blushing. &quot;Words are not necessary, Commander Joe&quot; she muttered painfully.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury travelled to the Nebulon's fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. Some manacles seemed to dominate the environment. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the willies,&quot; said Joe Mulbury slowly. He was looking smashing in a handsome brown leather jacket and some maroon leather slacks. The blue green silk sandals on his feet seemed to glow in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James dialed up the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro metrics look normal,&quot; smiled Ms. O'James lightly. She was wearing a blue and purple cotton trench coat with pale indigo star patterns. The marvellous red and purple denim shoes with shimmering rainbow hued lightning bolt patterns she was looking delightful in seemed to gleam in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, yeah... for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!&quot; mumbled Commander Joe heavily. He surveyed the area. With a gentle yet strong motion, he lifted the Venusian Staff of Power into the light. Suddenly, he stumbled. The Venusian Staff of Power slipped out of his grip.</p>
<p>The Venusian Staff of Power tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A sour look crept across Commander Joe Mulbury's face.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight glanced strongly at him. He was sporting a violet silk jerkin with gold coloured stripes and some black rayon trousers. Some handsome pinstripe denim dress shoes graced his feet.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity glared in the direction of Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury gestured to her to step away from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I wanted to say to you&quot;, he began slumblingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, about that time in the engine room...&quot; muttered Commander Joe awkwardly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went beet red with blushing. &quot;It's all right, Joe Mulbury, you don't need to say anything,&quot; she sighed painingly. She looked around. She all of a sudden had a funny hunch. She looked behind the nearby torch in a thing on the wall. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; cried Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Joe Mulbury said firmly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Joe Mulbury,&quot; she whispered strongly. &quot;I am indebted to you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; she breathed happily. &quot;I would have been a goner without you, Commander Serenity,&quot; she stated placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. A view screen gleamed in the fluorescent light. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James surveyed the area. She was looking fine in a silvery nylon jerkin with frilly multi hued lace and some dark violet rayon slacks with deep indigo moon beam patterns. The marvellous deep indigo rayon pixie boots with red and purple star patterns that she had on looked almost new. She suddenly had a funny hunch. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; yelled Dwight Edgmont. &quot;There was some ace thinking I saw from you today, Serenity Starlight!&quot; he chirped courageously. He was looking ready for action in a fine maroon polyester sweater with white stripes and some fine pinstripe cotton culottes. The handsome gold coloured nylon boots on his feet seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Captain, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; he said calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; smiled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James, blushing fiercely like a tiger. &quot;It's enough to know I'm fighting on the side of good!&quot;. &quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; she giggled fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a curry right now,&quot; whispered Commander Joe happily.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; drawled Captain Dwight peacefully.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Tammy Smith. She was gotten up in a brown denim halter top with a tacky purple zig zag pattern and some orange red crinkly foil slacks. On her feet she wore some gaudy orange red denim sandals. &quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; she sighed lightly.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-time-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">19. The Time of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you'd expect. In the centre of the area was a communications panel. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the navigation dashboard. She was decked out in an elegant pale purple nylon blouse with silver and purple moon beam patterns and some marvellous shimmering rainbow hued dacron leggings with frilly shimmering rainbow hued lace. Her feet were shod with some exquisite gold coloured silk sneakers with frilly deep indigo lace.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the communications panel. He put his hand up to his perfect brow. He was wearing a handsome orange red cotton suit jacket and some snappy green denim slacks. Some snappy purple leather sneakers graced his feet. &quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight,&quot; he sighed with an enigmatic twitch of his mouth.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the air conditioning unit. &quot;Hello, Commander Serenity,&quot; he breathed blissfully.</p>

<p>Then, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! She was looking menacing in a dark black rayon jumper and a deep red silk skirt. Her scarred mouth in profile threw a shadow on the view screen. On her feet she wore some blood red leather shoes with red nylon trim.</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; barked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled maniacally. &quot;We meet again, do-gooders!&quot; she whispered with a voice like a rabid dog in a bazaar. She snatched Navigator Tammy from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with her.</p>
<p>&quot;OH NO!&quot; barked Commander Joe emphatically.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight put his hands to his cheeks in surprise. He put his hand up to his wide brow. The brown crinkly foil muscle shirt he was sporting seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. His feet were shod in some tie dyed dacron sneakers.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James made gestures of surprise with her arms.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. He held the electro wrench in his hand. &quot;This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,&quot; he said firmly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury motioned Commander Serenity to step away from the others for a moment. &quot;There's something I need to talk to you about&quot;, he mumbled coyly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury scratched his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Commander Serenity.</p>
<p>The faces of Joe Mulbury and Ms. O'James moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury looked away.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Commander Serenity. Her wicked cute forehead in profile threw a shadow on the Captain's chair.</p>
<p>The faces of Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James and Commander Joe moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Commander Joe put his hand behind his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>Their faces inched closer and closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, ...&quot; said Joe Mulbury painingly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>The faces of Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James and Commander Joe moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury scratched his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>Their faces inched closer and closer.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury looked away.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>The faces of Joe Mulbury and Ms. O'James moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, ...&quot; said Joe Mulbury painingly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Commander Serenity.</p>
<p>The faces of Commander Joe and Serenity Starlight moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Commander Joe put his hand behind his head.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Commander Serenity.</p>
<p>Their faces inched closer and closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, ... there comes a time when...&quot; whispered Joe Mulbury carefully.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was wearing a handsome deep red crinkly foil jersey and some midnight black leather leggings. His jutting chin seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. The handsome dark red nylon shoes with red stripes that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; bellowed Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. &quot;What have we here!&quot; he breathed with a voice like an elephant in a gymnasium parking lot. He snatched Dwight Edgmont from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with him.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury's mouth gawped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity barked &quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot;.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the Nebulon's fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. There was a door to the dungeon off in the corner. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the willies,&quot; intoned Commander Joe weakly. He was looking fine in a snappy yellow denim jerkin and some tie dyed leather leggings with tie dyed dacron trim. The black crinkly foil trainers that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro metrics look normal,&quot; said Commander Serenity, peering down at her hyper crystal's enviro probe app. She was wearing a rainbow coloured polyester robe adorned with jewels. On her feet she wore some shiny silver dacron pixie boots adorned with emeralds.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, yeah... for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!&quot; droned Joe Mulbury slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James barked icily.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was there, locked in a cage! He was resplendent in a blue dacron muscle shirt and some pinstripe nylon trousers. His feet were shod in some pinstripe polyester sandals with orange cotton trim.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Commander Joe,&quot; he giggled placidly. &quot;I am indebted to you, Ms. O'James,&quot; he smiled laughingly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James spotted some Space Slugs in the distance.</p>
<p>&quot;Looks like they've spotted us,&quot; giggled Captain Dwight blissfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Xehfi cgqtvg gjcyseyu!!!&quot; shouted the Space Slugs in their strange Space Slug language.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight gritted his teeth and determined to stay upbeat.</p>
<p>A epic battle had begun!</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James ran to the side, to try to attack the Space Slugs from behind. She wasn't looking where she was going and bumped into Joe Mulbury in a most embarrassing fashion.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury glanced enigmatically at her.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James went beet red with blushing.</p>
<p>Unperturbed, Commander Joe rushed back into the fight.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity ran to the side, looking to attack the Space Slugs from the rear. She wasn't looking where she was going and bumped into Commander Joe in a most embarrassing fashion.</p>
<p>Commander Joe looked at her.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight blushed a deep red.</p>
<p>Unperturbed, Joe Mulbury rushed back into the fray.</p>
<p>When the dust had settled, dazed Space Slugs were strewn across the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close call!&quot; chirped Captain Dwight calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;It looked like those Space Slugs had The Skull Witch's insignia on their clothes,&quot; whispered Serenity Starlight calmly. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; mumbled Joe Mulbury drily. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; he intoned unhappily.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been a goner without you, Commander Joe,&quot; she chirped courageously. She was looking tastless in a tasteless purple leather shirt and some outdated tie dyed silk culottes with a tacky white zig zag pattern. Some ill fitting violet leather sandals were on her feet. &quot;Thank you, Captain Dwight,&quot; she breathed courageously. &quot;I am indebted to you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; she said obsequiously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. A Captain's chair gleamed in the fluorescent light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw you display some top notch thinking today, Serenity Starlight!&quot; said Dwight Edgmont blissfully. He was looking exciting in a navy blue denim jumper and some floral print dacron slacks. On his feet he wore some chartreuse dacron shoes. &quot;I think I should promote you to Captain, Commander Serenity!&quot; he drawled firmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; blushed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James courageously. She was looking smashing in an exquisite purple and violet nylon frock with dark indigo lacy frills and some beautiful crimson denim leggings with white lightning bolt patterns. Some beautiful gold coloured rayon pixie boots with pale purple nylon trim graced her feet. &quot;I'm too modest, I like being a Commander too!&quot;. She flumped down on the sofa.</p>
<p>With a graceful yet confident motion, Commander Joe slumped down on the sofa. He was wearing a handsome violet cotton smock with violet dacron trim. His feet were shod with some pinstripe nylon sneakers.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a soda right now,&quot; chirped Navigator Tammy enigmatically.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="19"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-mystery-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">20. The Mystery of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. In the centre of the area was a navigation dashboard. A few Space Gnats flew around.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the communications panel. She was decked out in a fantastic shimmering rainbow hued dacron jerkin with shimmering rainbow coloured moon beam patterns and some exquisite silver and purple rayon leggings with crimson and violet moon beam patterns. The exquisite silvery silk dress shoes adorned with rubies that she had on looked almost new. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her perky shoulder length rainbow hued locks.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the Captain's chair. He was wearing a black nylon jersey and some blue leather leggings. His long auburn hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. Some fine orange red silk dress shoes were on his feet. &quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he chirped with an enigmatic twitch of his nose.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the communications panel. &quot;Hello, Joe Mulbury,&quot; he drawled placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She lifted the cup of coffee. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; she said energetically.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! Her scarred mouth in profile cast a shadow against the Captain's chair. She was looking menacing in a red nylon jersey and a black nylon skirt. Her feet were shod with some fine dark black crinkly foil dress shoes.</p>
<p>&quot;The Skull Witch!&quot; Ms. O'James bellowed.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled despicably. &quot;I have you now!&quot; she drawled with a voice like a rabid dog in a snowstorm. She snatched Dwight Edgmont from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with her.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith made gestures of surprise with her hands.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury's mouth gaped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James shouted &quot;NOOO!&quot;. With a gentle yet masterful motion, she picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. She held the electro wrench in her hand. &quot;This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,&quot; she he bellowedavily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! His close cropped green hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; yelled Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled hatefully. He was looking menacing in a red polyester shirt and some snappy blood red polyester trousers. The deep red leather boots that he had on looked almost new. &quot;So sorry to spoil your party, kiddies!&quot; he drawled with a voice like a hurricane in a gymnasium parking lot. He snatched Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with him.</p>
<p>&quot;NOOO!&quot; yelled Navigator Tammy drily. She was looking frumpy in a red leather dress. Her narrow mouth in profile threw a shadow on the navigation dashboard. On her feet she wore some orange dacron boots.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity put her hands to the sides of her face in shock.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where Commander Joe is being held!&quot; raged Tammy Smith strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Joe Mulbury is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; splurted Commander Serenity annoyingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; yelled Navigator Tammy threateningly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. A torch in a thing on the wall seemed to dominate the environment. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; mumbled Ms. O'James unhappily. She was sporting an elegant dark violet denim smock with frilly purple and gold lace. The elegant black and purple crinkly foil trainers with gold coloured lightning bolt patterns that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, Nebulon appeared! He was gotten up in a deep red polyester track suit. His feet were shod in some black cotton dress shoes.</p>
<p>&quot;Nebulon!&quot; Serenity Starlight screeched.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled disdainfully. &quot;We meet again, kiddies!&quot; he stated with a voice like a giraffe at a baseball game. He snatched Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with him.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James made gestures of shock with her hands. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she said emphatically.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage! She was looking frumpy in a gaudy pink silk great coat. The maroon crinkly foil shoes with gaudy orange polka dots on her feet seemed to shine in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been toast without you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; she drawled peacefully. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she said placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he chirped courageously. &quot;I would have been toast without you, Commander Serenity,&quot; he breathed enigmatically. He was wearing a fine blue green silk top and some fine red leather trousers. Some plaid dacron trainers graced his feet.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear something?&quot; Serenity Starlight giggled.</p>
<p>Without warning, with a stupendous crash, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Tammy Smith just stared, seemingly paralyzed. She was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury put his hands on the sides of his face in surprise.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight yelped &quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot;.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Ferrets came around the corner.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Ferrets!&quot; mouthed Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Mwczmbse biygkh jjfwim rztlo vjbpir wdr!!!&quot; shouted the Space Ferrets in their weird Space Ferret language.</p>
<p>A harrowing battle began!</p>
<p>&quot;BY THE MOUNTAINS OF MARS!!!&quot; yelled Joe Mulbury. He drew the Jovian battle axe out of his equipment bag. He raised the Jovian battle axe over his head. He brought down the Jovian battle axe with a tremendous force.</p>
<p>The Jovian battle axe made contact with the Space Ferrets with a tremendous whack.</p>
<p>The Space Ferrets went flying across the room. When the dust had cleared, dazed Space Ferrets littered the area.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close call!&quot; splurted Commander Joe gratingly.</p>
<p>&quot;It looked like those Space Ferrets had The Skull Witch's insignia on their uniforms,&quot; chirped Serenity Starlight placidly. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; bleated Commander Joe drably. &quot;We must act quickly!&quot; he said. He helped dig Navigator Tammy out from the rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no time to lose!&quot; Commander Serenity cried. She helped dig Tammy Smith out from the rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indebted to you, Joe Mulbury,&quot; sighed Navigator Tammy happily. &quot;Thank you, Commander Serenity,&quot; she smiled courageously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Otters attacked Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>A epic battle began!</p>
<p>&quot;BY THE MOUNTAINS OF MARS!!!&quot; yelled Navigator Tammy. She drew the electro mace out of her backpack. She heaved the electro mace over her head. She brought down the electro mace with a awesome movement.</p>
<p>The electro mace made contact with the Space Otters with a mighty thud.</p>
<p>The Space Otters went flying across the room. When the dust had cleared, dazed Space Otters were strewn across the area.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close one!&quot; muttered Tammy Smith sternly.</p>
<p>&quot;It looked like those Space Otters had Nebulon the Dastardly's insignia on their uniforms,&quot; smiled Joe Mulbury placidly. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; gulped Navigator Tammy drily.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Commander Joe sighed strongly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been a goner without you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he stated happily. He was sporting a yellow crinkly foil suit jacket and some orange red rayon leggings. On his feet he wore some white polyester sandals with tan stripes. &quot;I am in debt to you, Joe Mulbury,&quot; he breathed calmly. &quot;I am in debt to you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he said fawningly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commander Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you'd expect. There were some pulsing red and green lights off in the corner. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some quick thinking from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; breathed Dwight Edgmont firmly. He was resplendent in a plaid denim hoodie and some fine maroon rayon trousers. His feet were shod in some yellow nylon trainers. His wide brow seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Captain, Serenity Starlight!&quot; he stated lightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; drawled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James, blushing fiercely like a tiger. She was looking delightful in an elegant midnight black dacron sweater with deep violet lacy frills and some midnight black rayon culottes with midnight black moon beam patterns. The exquisite shimmering rainbow hued leather pixie boots with frilly shimmering multi hued lace that she had on looked almost new. &quot;It's enough to know I'm fighting on the side of good!&quot;. &quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; she chirped lightly.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; whispered Joe Mulbury virtuously. He was looking delightful in a snappy blue polyester suit jacket with gold coloured stripes and some floral print polyester culottes. Some mauve leather boots graced his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a curry right now,&quot; drawled Dwight Edgmont strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; said Tammy Smith laughingly.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="20"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-space-snails">21. The Space Snails</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. A Captain's chair seemed to dominate the environment. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was playing that new match three game on her hyper crystal. Her wicked cute forehead in profile threw a shadow on the pulsing red and green lights. She was looking impressive in a pale purple silk dress with shimmering rainbow coloured cotton trim. The crimson and violet silk boots with purple and violet polyester trim she was looking impressive in seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the communications panel. He was wearing a purple dacron jumper and some gold coloured crinkly foil leggings. Some snappy plaid leather sneakers were on his feet. &quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he whispered with an enigmatic twitch of his nose.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights. &quot;Hello, Commander Joe,&quot; he said with an enigmatic twitch of his nose.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was standing near the air conditioning unit. Her narrow mouth in profile cast a shadow against the view screen. She was looking frumpy in a pinstripe nylon sweater and some mauve leather trousers. The tasteless blue green leather sneakers with a tacky black zig zag pattern that were on her feet looked almost new. From out of nowhere, a cooking drone whizzed past her head. &quot;What in the world was that?&quot; she intoned strongly. She frowned heavily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! She was looking villanous in a snappy blood red rayon track suit. Her feet were shod in some blood coloured nylon dress shoes with deep black crinkly foil trim.</p>
<p>&quot;The Skull Witch!&quot; Joe Mulbury bellowed. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his long auburn locks.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled evilly. &quot;So sorry to spoil your little party, chums!&quot; she smiled with a voice like a giraffe in a bazaar. She snatched Navigator Tammy from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with her.</p>
<p>&quot;OH NO!&quot; bellowed Joe Mulbury viciously.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont gritted his teeth and determined to stay cheerful. His mouth gaped wide in surprise. His short black hair seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight clapped her hands to her cheeks in surprise. She picked up the star charts that were nearby. She lifted the star charts into the light. &quot;These star charts represents how I feel inside,&quot; she groaned threateningly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury gestured to her to step aside from the others for a moment. &quot;There's something I wanted to talk to you about&quot;, he gulped slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury put his hand behind his head.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>The faces of Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James and Joe Mulbury moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, ...&quot; breathed Commander Joe slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Captain Serenity.</p>
<p>The faces of Ms. O'James and Commander Joe moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury scratched his knee.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>The faces of Joe Mulbury and Ms. O'James moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, ... there comes a time when...&quot; whispered Commander Joe carefully.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; screamed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. His jutting chin seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. &quot;I have you now!&quot; he said with a voice like a crazed bull at a baseball game. He was looking impressive in a dark black denim suit jacket with dark black stripes and some fine dark red dacron culottes with red stripes. The deep red nylon boots on his feet seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. He snatched Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with him.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont made gestures of disbelief with his hands.</p>
<p>&quot;NOOO!&quot; screamed Serenity Starlight with a voice like a tiger in a jewellery store.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the Nebulon's fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. Nearby were some manacles. A few Space Bees buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the willies,&quot; muttered Serenity Starlight irksomely. She was wearing a beautiful multi coloured crinkly foil jumpsuit with deep violet lightning bolt patterns. Some marvellous silvery nylon trainers with pale indigo nylon trim were on her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro metrics look normal,&quot; bellowed Joe Mulbury, looking down at his hyper crystal's enviro probe app.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, normal... for a DUMP!!&quot; said Captain Serenity weakly.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Captain Dwight drawled blissfully. He was sporting a plaid silk great coat with blue polyester trim. On his feet he wore some tan dacron boots.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage! He was looking smashing in a handsome orange red dacron jersey and some purple cotton leggings. The floral print leather sneakers he was sporting seemed to shine in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Captain Dwight,&quot; he smiled lightly. &quot;I would have been a goner without you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he stated virtuously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James were attacked by some Space Snails.</p>
<p>A intense battle had begun!</p>
<p>Ms. O'James sprinted to the side, looking to attack them from behind. She wasn't watching where she was going and bumped into Joe Mulbury in a most embarrassing fashion.</p>
<p>Commander Joe glanced drily at her.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity went beet red with blushing.</p>
<p>Unperturbed, Commander Joe rushed back into the melee.</p>
<p>&quot;BY THE RINGS OF VENUS!!!&quot; squealed Captain Dwight. He drew the vibro sword out of his equipment bag. He lifted the vibro sword above his head. He brought down the vibro sword with a mighty movement.</p>
<p>The vibro sword made contact with the Space Snails with a mighty thud.</p>
<p>The Space Snails went flying across the room. When the dust had settled, dazed Space Snails littered the area.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close one!&quot; barked Joe Mulbury threateningly. &quot;It looked like those Space Snails had Nebulon the Dastardly's insignia on their jerseys,&quot; he whispered lightly. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; bleated Ms. O'James downheartedly. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she mumbled drably.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was there, locked in a cage! She was looking completely unimpressive in a maroon rayon suit jacket and some orange red crinkly foil slacks with a tacky pink zig zag pattern. The purple leather sneakers that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been lost without you, Joe Mulbury,&quot; she giggled fawningly. &quot;Thank you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; she stated obsequiously. &quot;I am indebted to you, Ms. O'James,&quot; she sighed enigmatically.</p>

His feet were shod with some snappy red silk dress shoes. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Commodore, Ms. O'James!&quot; he smiled obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Dwight Edgmont!&quot; sighed Serenity Starlight, blushing fiercely like a tiger. She was wearing a marvellous multi coloured silk halter top with frilly purple and gold lace and a beautiful black and purple nylon skirt with multi coloured cotton trim. Some WICKED AWESOME rainbow hued crinkly foil sneakers with shiny purple star patterns were on her feet. &quot;I'm not in this for rank, I do it out of love!&quot;. &quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; she said laughingly.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Joe Mulbury. He was looking smashing in a handsome orange red dacron suit jacket and some orange red denim slacks. On his feet he wore some black polyester sandals.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont flumped down on the bean bag chair.</p>

<p>&quot;That Chalice of Dreams means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Fighters Command doesn't entrust us with just any old thing, Navigator Tammy,&quot; Serenity Starlight stated placidly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was cracking open walnuts with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;That Saturnian Orb of Hope means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;It means a lot to all of us, Captain Serenity,&quot; Joe Mulbury smiled calmly. He looked around. He was decked out in a pink rayon suit jacket and some floral print dacron culottes. His feet were shod with some white rayon dress shoes. He held the Saturnian Orb of Hope in his hand. Suddenly, he lost his balance. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of his grasp.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoops,&quot; muttered Commander Joe quietly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy moved her soft yet powerful hand in the direction of him.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight gestured towards Joe Mulbury. He was looking ready for action in a handsome orange polyester jersey with tan stripes and some snappy silver coloured silk slacks. On his feet he wore some fine blue polyester dress shoes.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity looked at Commander Joe.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;It's Nebulon!&quot; Dwight Edgmont squealed.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled evilly. He was wearing a red rayon sweater and some fine blood coloured nylon trousers. The midnight black polyester boots that were on his feet looked almost new. &quot;What have we here!&quot; he giggled with a voice like a tiger in a jewellery store. He grabbed Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with him.</p>
<p>Commander Joe screeched &quot;NOOO!&quot;.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont's mouth gawped wide in disbelief. His wide brow seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James put her hands to the sides of her face in disbelief.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury picked up the star charts that were nearby. He held the star charts in his hand. &quot;These star charts represents how I feel inside,&quot; he bellowed emphatically.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity surveyed the area. She lifted the Chalice of Dreams. Without warning, she stumbled. She lost her grip on the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>The Chalice of Dreams tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A sheepish look crept across Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's face.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury glared in the direction of her.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont looked at Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury motioned Captain Serenity to step aside from the others for a moment. &quot;There's something I wanted to talk about&quot;, he breathed carefully.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Captain Serenity.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, about that time in the engine room...&quot; gasped Commander Joe enigmatically.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James blushed a deep red. &quot;Speak not of it, Joe Mulbury&quot; she gasped enigmatically. She surveyed the area with her eyes. She all of a sudden had a odd intuition. She looked behind the nearby Captain's chair. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; squealed Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the Nebulon's fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. A door to the dungeon gleamed in the dim torch light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; said Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James weakly. She was sporting an elegant purple and violet leather hoodie adorned with emeralds and some elegant silver and purple cotton culottes with crimson denim trim. On her feet she wore some beautiful silver and purple crinkly foil pixie boots with silver coloured nylon trim.</p>
<p>With a supple yet firm motion, Dwight Edgmont dialed up the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro measurements look normal,&quot; drawled Dwight Edgmont energetically. He was sporting a floral print leather jumper and some maroon dacron trousers. The tan nylon sneakers with pink leather trim on his feet seemed to gleam in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>&quot;... For a DUMP!!&quot; intoned Ms. O'James irritatedly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe gestured to her to step aside from the others for a moment. He was looking smashing in a brown nylon muscle shirt and some silver coloured cotton leggings. Some snappy black rayon boots graced his feet. &quot;There's something I need to say to you&quot;, he sighed slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Captain Serenity.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, about the other day in the loading bay...&quot; muttered Commander Joe painfully.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight went beet red with blushing. &quot;Hush, Commander Joe, there's no need, you know that,&quot; she mumbled carefully.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear something?&quot; Joe Mulbury groaned.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Captain Dwight stood frozen like a deer in headlights. He was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury's mouth gawped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; cried Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James drably.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, Nebulon appeared! His jutting chin in profile threw a shadow on the door to the dungeon. He was looking intimidating in a snappy dark black leather shirt and some blood coloured silk trousers with dark black cotton trim. His feet were shod in some dark black nylon dress shoes.</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; barked Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wickedly. &quot;We meet again, chums!&quot; he said with a voice like a gangster in a bazaar. He grabbed Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with him.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight shouted &quot;OH NO!&quot;. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she said outrageously.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been lost without you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he drawled placidly. He wasted no time. He helped dig Captain Dwight out from the rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;Hurry!&quot; Ms. O'James chirped. She helped dig Dwight Edgmont out from the rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Joe Mulbury,&quot; smiled Dwight Edgmont happily. &quot;I am indebted to you, Ms. O'James,&quot; he giggled courageously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Ostriches came around the corner.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Ostriches!&quot; hissed Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;Ois trki kjgbdz!!!&quot; shouted the Space Ostriches in their strange Space Ostriche language.</p>
<p>A fierce battle began!</p>
<p>When the dust had settled, dazed Space Ostriches littered the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close one!&quot; breathed Dwight Edgmont placidly. &quot;It looked like those Space Ostriches had The Skull Witch's insignia on their jerseys,&quot; he chirped enigmatically. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; said Commander Joe downheartedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight whispered virtuously.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage! She was gotten up in a tasteless violet dacron blouse with a tacky orange zig zag pattern and some gaudy silver coloured crinkly foil leggings. On her feet she wore some green nylon trainers.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Commander Joe,&quot; she said obsequiously. She put her hand up to her narrow mouth. &quot;I am indebted to you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; she said lightly. &quot;I would have been toast without you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; she giggled fawningly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. There was a navigation dashboard off in the distance. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James looked around. She was looking delightful in an elegant crimson polyester sweater with indigo lightning bolt patterns and some deep violet denim leggings with dark indigo cotton trim. Some elegant purple crinkly foil dress shoes with shiny silver moon beam patterns were on her feet. She suddenly had a funny intuition. She looked behind the nearby view screen. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; cried Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw you display some top notch action today, Captain Serenity!&quot; chirped Dwight Edgmont virtuously. He was looking exciting in a mauve dacron sweater and some snappy blue green cotton trousers. The pinstripe nylon boots that were on his feet looked almost new. &quot;I think I should promote you to Commodore, Ms. O'James!&quot; he sighed virtuously.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; blushed Captain Serenity placidly. &quot;It's enough to know I'm fighting on the side of good!&quot;. &quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; she sighed lightly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe slumped down on the sofa.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a hamburger after that,&quot; breathed Navigator Tammy strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Joe Mulbury,&quot; giggled Dwight Edgmont enigmatically.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="22"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-phantom-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">23. The Phantom of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. There was a navigation dashboard off in the corner. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the view screen. She was looking impressive in some marvellous dark purple polyester coveralls with blue and purple lightning bolt patterns. Her feet were shod with some WICKED AWESOME purple leather pumps with rainbow coloured nylon trim. Her perky shoulder length rainbow hued hair seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the Captain's chair. He was looking impressive in a silver coloured rayon sweater and some mauve polyester trousers. His perfect brow in profile cast a shadow against the navigation dashboard. The handsome brown denim sneakers that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Commander Joe,&quot; smiled Captain Dwight Edgmont courageously. He was intently cleaning the Chalice of Dreams. His wide brow seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>&quot;That Chalice of Dreams, it's pretty special, isn't it?&quot; asked Navigator Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Fighters Command doesn't entrust us with just any old thing, Navigator Tammy,&quot; Captain Dwight chirped happily. He was resplendent in some snappy purple silk coveralls with plaid stripes. His feet were shod in some orange silk dress shoes.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was meticulously cleaning the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That Star Jewel of Eternity means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the kind of thing you can just order from Omnizon, Joe Mulbury,&quot; Tammy Smith sighed virtuously. She was looking tastless in a bleak red silk frock and some chartreuse cotton trousers. The red rayon pixie boots she was wearing seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. She surveyed the area. Her narrow mouth in profile cast a shadow against the Captain's chair. She held the Star Jewel of Eternity in her hand. All of a sudden, she was distracted. She lost her grip on the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>The Star Jewel of Eternity tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoops,&quot; whispered Tammy Smith quietly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe moved his soft yet powerful hand in the direction of her.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont pointed towards Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity moved her graceful yet powerful hand in the direction of Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was looking intimidating in some dark red nylon coveralls. On his feet he wore some fine red denim sandals with red stripes.</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; yelled Captain Serenity.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. His jutting chin in profile threw a shadow on the navigation dashboard. &quot;I have you now!&quot; he breathed with a voice like a hurricane in a snowstorm. He snatched Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made gestures of surprise with her hands.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight clapped his hands to his cheeks in shock.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's mouth gaped wide in surprise.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. With a soft yet strong motion, she lifted the cup of coffee into the light. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; she groaned enigmatically.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight looked around. He held the Chalice of Dreams in his hand. Suddenly, he lost his balance. The Chalice of Dreams slipped out of his grasp.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>A crestfallen look crept across Captain Dwight Edgmont's face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy glanced heavily at him.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight moved her gentle yet powerful arm in the direction of Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared! She put her hand up to her scarred mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;It's The Skull Witch!&quot; Ms. O'James bellowed.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wickedly. She was wearing a snappy blood red denim suit jacket with deep red stripes and some deep black rayon leggings. Some fine black crinkly foil shoes graced her feet. &quot;We meet again, kiddies!&quot; she chirped with a voice like a samurai at a monster truck rally. She grabbed Dwight Edgmont from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with her.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; yelled Tammy Smith with a voice like a ninja at a baseball game.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight made motions of shock with her hands.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the Nebulon's fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you'd expect. Not too far away was a door to the dungeon. A few Space Mosquitoes buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; droned Serenity Starlight irksomely. She was wearing an elegant purple and violet polyester suit jacket adorned with rubies and a multi hued leather skirt with crimson and purple moon beam patterns. The purple and gold rayon dress shoes with crimson and violet star patterns that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro readings look normal,&quot; breathed Captain Dwight, gazing down at his hyper crystal's enviro probe app.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!&quot; mumbled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James drably. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she gasped slowly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in debt to you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he breathed peacefully. &quot;I would have been toast without you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; he smiled strongly. He was looking exciting in a navy blue silk muscle shirt with navy blue stripes and some handsome black silk leggings. On his feet he wore some floral print cotton boots.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you'd expect. A navigation dashboard seemed to dominate the environment. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James surveyed the area. The elegant shimmering multi hued silk jumper with frilly purple lace she was looking impressive in seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. Her feet were shod in some marvellous white silk trainers with silvery polyester trim. She all of a sudden had a strange hunch. She looked behind the nearby Captain's chair. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; cried Navigator Tammy. She was wearing a yellow leather jerkin and some outdated maroon nylon slacks. Some outdated plaid nylon boots with a tacky plaid zig zag pattern were on her feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. A puddle of icky looking liquid gleamed in the dim torch light. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James spotted some Space Ostriches in the distance.</p>
<p>&quot;Looks like they've found us,&quot; said Tammy Smith blissfully. She was looking frumpy in a violet leather shirt and some floral print denim leggings with gaudy chartreuse polka dots. The tacky purple cotton dress shoes with gaudy plaid polka dots she was looking tastless in seemed to shine in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>&quot;Kjg tjboar vlkwea mpjpvwau shgl gmeyk xudke!!!&quot; shouted the Space Ostriches in their strange Space Ostriche language.</p>
<p>A epic skirmish ensued!</p>
<p>&quot;BY THE RINGS OF VENUS!!!&quot; cried Dwight Edgmont. He drew the vibro sword out of his backpack. He was looking ready for action in a green silk suit jacket and some navy blue polyester trousers with purple stripes. His feet were shod with some snappy pink denim trainers. He lifted the vibro sword over his head. He brought down the vibro sword with a mighty movement.</p>
<p>The vibro sword made contact with the Space Ostriches with a tremendous impact.</p>
<p>The Space Ostriches went flying across the room.</p>
<p>&quot;BY THE RINGS OF VENUS!!!&quot; cried Captain Dwight. He drew the vibro sword out of his backpack. He raised the vibro sword above his head. He brought down the vibro sword with a awesome power.</p>
<p>The vibro sword made contact with the Space Ostriches with a mighty impact.</p>
<p>The Space Ostriches went flying across the room. When the dust had settled, stunned Space Ostriches were strewn across the area.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close one!&quot; drawled Captain Dwight placidly. &quot;It looked like those Space Ostriches had The Skull Witch's insignia on their uniforms,&quot; he sighed strongly. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; bleated Captain Serenity unhappily. She was decked out in a fantastic midnight black rayon robe with crimson and purple lacy frills. On her feet she wore some exquisite crimson and purple polyester sandals with silver and purple cotton trim.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Tammy Smith said placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage! He was looking fine in a chartreuse leather muscle shirt and some snappy silver coloured cotton culottes with pink stripes. Some green leather trainers were on his feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he said happily. &quot;I am indebted to you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; he breathed placidly. &quot;Thank you, Captain Serenity,&quot; he stated happily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. Some pulsing red and green lights gleamed in the fluorescent light. A few Space Bees buzzed around.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James looked around. She was looking fine in a fantastic shiny purple rayon dress with midnight black lightning bolt patterns. The shiny purple nylon sneakers with dark purple lacy frills that were on her feet looked almost new. She suddenly had a funny intuition. She looked behind the nearby view screen. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; exclaimed Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some quick thinking I saw from you today, Captain Serenity!&quot; giggled Captain Dwight firmly. &quot;I think I should promote you to Commodore, Captain Serenity!&quot; he sighed laughingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Dwight Edgmont!&quot; whispered Ms. O'James blissfully. &quot;I'm too modest, I like being a Captain too!&quot;. &quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; she chirped virtuously.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; sighed Commander Joe laughingly. He was wearing a plaid rayon jerkin and some fine black polyester culottes. On his feet he wore some maroon nylon boots with white stripes.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; stated Dwight Edgmont fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a parmo after that,&quot; sighed Tammy Smith enigmatically. She was gotten up in a white cotton great coat with a tacky blue zig zag pattern. Some white crinkly foil pixie boots were on her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Tammy Smith,&quot; breathed Commander Joe enigmatically.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="23"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-return-of-the-star-jewel-of-eternity">24. The Return of The Star Jewel of Eternity</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you'd expect. In the centre of the area was a navigation dashboard. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was standing near the Captain's chair. She was looking impressive in a beautiful rainbow coloured polyester suit jacket with pale violet star patterns and a shiny purple silk skirt with midnight black star patterns. Her feet were shod in some fantastic indigo leather pumps with rainbow hued moon beam patterns.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Ms. O'James,&quot; whispered Commander Joe Mulbury blissfully. His long auburn hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. He was looking smashing in an orange crinkly foil track suit. Some purple rayon shoes were on his feet.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the navigation dashboard. &quot;Hello, Commander Joe,&quot; he breathed laughingly. He was looking exciting in a plaid dacron trench coat with red rayon trim. His wide brow seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. On his feet he wore some fine violet crinkly foil shoes with yellow nylon trim.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the navigation dashboard.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was cracking open walnuts with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That Star Jewel of Eternity, it's kind of special, isn't it?&quot; asked Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;It means a lot to all of us, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; Commander Joe breathed enigmatically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy was cracking open walnuts with the Saturnian Orb of Hope. She was looking frumpy in an orange crinkly foil smock. The bleak maroon leather boots with gaudy maroon polka dots that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;That Saturnian Orb of Hope, it's kind of special, isn't it?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the sort of thing you can just order on Omnizon, Commander Joe,&quot; Tammy Smith stated obsequiously.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; yelled Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled maniacally. His jutting chin in profile cast a shadow against the Captain's chair. He was looking menacing in a red nylon long coat with blood red rayon trim. The dark red leather boots with blood red dacron trim that he had on looked almost new. &quot;What have we here!&quot; he smiled with a voice like a baboon in a bazaar. He snatched Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with him.</p>
<p>&quot;OH NO!&quot; yelled Navigator Tammy with a voice like a tiger at a monster truck rally.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury's mouth gaped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity clapped her hands on the sides of her face in shock.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where that villian has taken Dwight Edgmont!&quot; said Joe Mulbury irritatedly.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Dwight Edgmont is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; shouted Ms. O'James icily.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; shouted Joe Mulbury acidly.</p>
<p>With a smooth yet powerful motion, Navigator Tammy picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; she barked viciously.</p>
<p>With a smooth yet powerful motion, Commander Joe motioned Captain Serenity to step back from the others for a moment. &quot;There's something I need to talk to you about&quot;, he began awkwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, about the other day in the engine room...&quot; groaned Commander Joe slumblingly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James blushed a deep red. &quot;Words are not necessary, Commander Joe&quot; she whispered painfully.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith looked around. She lifted the Saturnian Orb of Hope to eye level. Without warning, she stumbled. She lost her grip on the Saturnian Orb of Hope. Her narrow mouth seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>The Saturnian Orb of Hope tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A sheepish look crept across Navigator Tammy Smith's face.</p>
<p>Commander Joe glared in the direction of her.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity looked at Navigator Tammy. She surveyed the area. She all of a sudden had a strange inkling. She looked behind the nearby air conditioning unit. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; exclaimed Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. Some manacles gleamed in the dim torch light. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; gasped Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James enigmatically. She was decked out in an exquisite blue and purple polyester leotard adorned with sapphires. On her feet she wore some beautiful silver and purple denim trainers with blue and purple moon beam patterns.</p>
<p>Commander Joe dialed up the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro readings look normal,&quot; drawled Commander Joe virtuously.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a DISASTER AREA!!&quot; groaned Serenity Starlight grumpily. She put her hand up to her wicked cute forehead.</p>
<p>Commander Joe looked around. He was sporting a handsome navy blue rayon jacket with navy blue stripes and some violet cotton culottes. His feet were shod in some tie dyed silk shoes. With a exquisite yet powerful motion, he lifted the Star Jewel of Eternity to eye level. Suddenly, he was distracted. The Star Jewel of Eternity slipped out of his hand.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;Drat,&quot; said Commander Joe quietly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith glanced weakly at him. She was looking tastless in a yellow polyester leotard. Some red polyester pumps graced her feet.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James glared in the direction of Commander Joe.</p>
<p>With a soft yet forceful motion, Commander Joe gestured to her to step aside from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I wanted to say to you&quot;, he began carefully.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>Commander Joe scratched his neck.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Captain Serenity.</p>
<p>The faces of Serenity Starlight and Joe Mulbury moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, ... there comes a time when...&quot; whispered Commander Joe painingly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James were attacked by some Space Snails.</p>
<p>A fierce skirmish took place!</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James ran to the side, to try to attack them from behind. She wasn't looking where she was going and bumped into Commander Joe in a most embarrassing fashion.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury looked at her.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went beet red with blushing.</p>
<p>Unperturbed, Commander Joe rushed back into the fight.</p>
<p>When the dust had settled, stunned Space Snails were strewn across the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close one!&quot; sighed Captain Serenity awkwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;It looked like those Space Snails had Nebulon the Dastardly's insignia on their clothes,&quot; drawled Joe Mulbury courageously. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; intoned Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James grumpily. She surveyed the area with her eyes. She all of a sudden had a odd inkling. She looked behind the nearby door to the dungeon. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; cried Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Ms. O'James giggled strongly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage! He was looking exciting in a green nylon jacket and some handsome chartreuse denim culottes with blue green stripes. On his feet he wore some handsome pink dacron shoes.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indebted to you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he breathed happily. &quot;Thank you, Commander Joe,&quot; he breathed placidly. &quot;I would have been toast without you, Ms. O'James,&quot; he chirped energetically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. A navigation dashboard seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Bees flew around.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw you display some top notch action today, Serenity Starlight!&quot; smiled Dwight Edgmont happily. &quot;I think I should promote you to Commodore, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; he whispered lightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; stated Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. She was sporting a WICKED AWESOME deep violet leather tank top with frilly shimmering multi hued lace and some marvellous shiny silver cotton culottes with dark indigo lacy frills. Some fantastic pale violet polyester sneakers adorned with emeralds graced her feet. &quot;It's enough to know I'm fighting on the side of good!&quot;. &quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; she breathed laughingly.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; stated Joe Mulbury obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a hamburger right now,&quot; stated Dwight Edgmont enigmatically.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; breathed Tammy Smith blissfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Saturnian Orb of Hope, Tammy Smith,&quot; whispered Commander Joe fawningly. He was looking delightful in a mauve rayon top with green stripes and some snappy mauve denim trousers. The pink nylon shoes with blue green stripes on his feet seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="24"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-return-of-the-return-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">25. The Return of The Return of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. There was a Captain's chair off in the corner. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was standing near the communications panel. She was sporting an elegant dark violet denim great coat with frilly purple and white lace. Her feet were shod with some shiny purple silk sandals with multi hued moon beam patterns. Her wicked cute forehead in profile threw a shadow on the navigation dashboard.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the communications panel. He was sporting a yellow crinkly foil trench coat with gold coloured leather trim. The white leather trainers that were on his feet looked almost new. &quot;Hello, Captain Serenity,&quot; he said with an enigmatic twitch of his ears.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Captain Dwight,&quot; whispered Navigator Tammy Smith with an enigmatic twitch of her nose.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James was intently cleaning the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That Star Jewel of Eternity means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Commander Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;It means a lot to all of us, Joe Mulbury,&quot; Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James giggled courageously.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;Nebulon!&quot; Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James screamed.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled hatefully. &quot;So sorry to spoil your party, kiddies!&quot; he chirped with a voice like a ninja in a snowstorm. He was looking menacing in a handsome midnight black rayon long coat with blood coloured stripes. The deep red dacron sneakers that were on his feet looked almost new. He snatched Navigator Tammy from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with him.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury put his hands on the sides of his face in disbelief. He was looking smashing in an orange crinkly foil jacket and some brown cotton trousers. Some red nylon shoes graced his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; exclaimed Captain Dwight laughingly.</p>
<p>Captain Serenity shouted &quot;OH NO!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where Tammy Smith is being held!&quot; stated Dwight Edgmont enigmatically.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Navigator Tammy is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; muttered Serenity Starlight menacingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; yelped Captain Dwight energetically. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his short black hair. He picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. He held the electro wrench in his hand. &quot;This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,&quot; he breathed courageously.</p>
<p>From out of nowhere, a delivery drone flew close by Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's head. &quot;What was that?&quot; she said sternly. She frowned icily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; bellowed Captain Serenity.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wickedly. She was wearing a black dacron dress. Her long green hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. Her feet were shod with some deep red crinkly foil boots. &quot;I have you now!&quot; she chirped with a voice like a gorilla in a pet shop. She grabbed Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont's mouth gaped wide in shock.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight made gestures of surprise with her hands.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you'd expect. There was a door to the dungeon off in the corner. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the creeps,&quot; droned Serenity Starlight slowly. She was looking smashing in a fantastic deep indigo crinkly foil jumper with blue and purple lacy frills and some beautiful rainbow coloured nylon leggings with pale indigo lacy frills. On her feet she wore some exquisite deep indigo cotton boots with dark violet crinkly foil trim.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro measurements look normal,&quot; whispered Dwight Edgmont, looking down at his hyper crystal's enviro probe app.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a PIT!!&quot; said Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James exasperatedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Dwight Edgmont stated happily. The white rayon top he was sporting seemed to gleam in the dim torch light. His feet were shod in some floral print polyester shoes.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in debt to you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; he breathed happily. He was looking delightful in an orange leather jacket with chartreuse stripes and some floral print polyester trousers with maroon stripes. Some white leather dress shoes graced his feet. &quot;I would have been toast without you, Captain Serenity,&quot; he drawled energetically.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James looked around. She held the Star Jewel of Eternity in her hand. All of a sudden, she was distracted. The Star Jewel of Eternity slipped out of her grasp.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>A crestfallen look crept across Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's face.</p>
<p>Commander Joe glanced enigmatically at her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight glanced lightly at Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, Nebulon appeared! He was looking intimidating in a snappy dark black polyester suit jacket and some fine deep black crinkly foil culottes. The fine black denim sandals that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Nebulon!&quot; Captain Serenity yelled.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wickedly. &quot;What have we here!&quot; he chirped with a voice like a baboon in a jewellery store. His jutting chin in profile cast a shadow against the puddle of icky looking liquid. He grabbed Dwight Edgmont from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with him.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; screeched Commander Joe acidly. The dim torch light of the stronghold fortress of Nebulon cast highlights on his long auburn hair.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight yelled &quot;OH NO!&quot;. She picked up the shards of broken glass that were nearby. She lifted the shards of broken glass to eye level. &quot;These shards of broken glass represents how I feel inside,&quot; she shouted menacingly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury motioned her to step aside from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I wanted to say to you&quot;, he began slumblingly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, about that time in the engine room...&quot; mumbled Commander Joe painfully.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James blushed a deep red. She held her finger up to Commander Joe Mulbury's lips.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Snails came around the corner.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Snails!&quot; squeaked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;Ouxampk xohdjuvt pqoxlbys!!!&quot; shouted the Space Snails in their weird Space Snail language.</p>
<p>A harrowing battle took place!</p>
<p>&quot;BY THE MOUNTAINS OF MARS!!!&quot; barked Commander Joe. He drew the Jovian battle axe out of his belt. He heaved the Jovian battle axe over his head. He brought down the Jovian battle axe with a tremendous power.</p>
<p>The Jovian battle axe made contact with the Space Snails with a awesome impact.</p>
<p>The Space Snails went flying across the room. When the dust had settled, dazed Space Snails were strewn across the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close one!&quot; muttered Ms. O'James acidly.</p>
<p>&quot;It looked like those Space Snails had The Skull Witch's insignia on their uniforms,&quot; smiled Commander Joe laughingly. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; muttered Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James heavily. She surveyed the area with her eyes. She suddenly had a odd intuition. She looked behind the nearby door to the dungeon. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; yelped Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Commander Joe whispered blissfully.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Joe Mulbury,&quot; he whispered laughingly. &quot;I am in debt to you, Captain Serenity,&quot; he said peacefully.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Commander Joe chirped strongly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been toast without you, Commander Joe,&quot; she chirped courageously. She was looking tastless in a yellow cotton track suit with a tacky blue green zig zag pattern. Her narrow mouth in profile threw a shadow on the puddle of icky looking liquid. On her feet she wore some plaid denim pixie boots with a tacky blue green zig zag pattern. &quot;I am indebted to you, Captain Dwight,&quot; she breathed obsequiously. &quot;Thank you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; she smiled calmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Captain Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. Some pulsing red and green lights seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Bees flew around.</p>
<p>&quot;That was some quick thinking I saw from you today, Captain Serenity!&quot; whispered Dwight Edgmont placidly. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Commodore, Serenity Starlight!&quot; he sighed energetically.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; blushed Ms. O'James virtuously. She was sporting a fantastic purple and white nylon top with multi coloured star patterns and some fantastic purple and white denim culottes with pale purple star patterns. The beautiful dark indigo leather shoes with purple moon beam patterns that she had on looked almost new. &quot;I'm too modest, I like being a Captain too!&quot;. She flumped down on the bean bag chair.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; stated Joe Mulbury virtuously. He was sporting a violet dacron robe. On his feet he wore some snappy floral print leather boots.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a soda right now,&quot; chirped Dwight Edgmont fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Navigator Tammy. She was looking tastless in some black polyester coveralls. Some floral print denim sneakers were on her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Captain Serenity,&quot; giggled Joe Mulbury fawningly.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="25"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-scourge-of-the-skull-witch">26. The Scourge of The Skull Witch</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was a sight to behold. Nearby was a communications panel. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was playing that new match three game on her hyper crystal. The marvellous silver coloured leather top with crimson and purple nylon trim she was looking fine in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. Her feet were shod in some shimmering multi hued dacron trainers with silvery lightning bolt patterns.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the navigation dashboard. He was wearing a tan denim shirt and some mauve nylon culottes. His long auburn hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. The floral print cotton trainers with orange stripes that were on his feet looked almost new. &quot;Hello, Commodore Serenity,&quot; he chirped energetically.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the view screen. He was intently cleaning the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That Star Jewel of Eternity means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Commodore Serenity.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Fighters Command doesn't entrust us with just any old thing, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; Dwight Edgmont whispered energetically. With a graceful yet confident motion, he picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. His wide brow in profile cast a shadow against the pulsing red and green lights. He was wearing a navy blue leather jacket and some fine silver coloured crinkly foil leggings. Some fine pink silk trainers graced his feet. He held the cup of coffee in his hand. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; he breathed calmly.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James motioned Commander Joe to step aside from the others for a moment. Her wicked cute forehead seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. &quot;There's a thing I wanted to talk about&quot;, she began awkwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Commodore Serenity?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, ...&quot; sighed Commodore Serenity painingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Ms. O'James?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>The faces of Ms. O'James and Commander Joe moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James looked away.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Commodore Serenity?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>The faces of Commander Joe and Ms. O'James moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James put her hand behind her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Serenity Starlight?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Their faces inched closer and closer.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, ... there comes a time when...&quot; said Serenity Starlight painfully.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont looked around. He lifted the Star Jewel of Eternity. Without warning, he stumbled. He lost his grip on the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>The Star Jewel of Eternity tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Drat,&quot; chirped Dwight Edgmont quietly.</p>
<p>With a smooth yet confident motion, Navigator Tammy Smith pointed towards him.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury looked at Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James glared in the direction of Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared! She was gotten up in a midnight black leather top and some black cotton culottes. On her feet she wore some red denim shoes with blood coloured dacron trim. She put her hand up to her scarred mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; exclaimed Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wildly. &quot;We meet again, do-gooders!&quot; she breathed with a voice like a crazed bull in a video arcade. She grabbed Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with her.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith put her hands on the sides of her face in disbelief. She was looking tastless in a blue nylon hoodie and some black denim trousers. Her feet were shod with some chartreuse denim boots.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont's mouth opened wide in surprise.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity made gestures of surprise with her hands.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. Her narrow mouth seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; she bellowed threateningly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith travelled to the Nebulon's fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. A torch in a thing on the wall gleamed in the dim torch light. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the chills,&quot; intoned Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James drily. She was wearing a marvellous purple leather top with pale purple moon beam patterns and some fantastic purple and white rayon culottes with gold coloured moon beam patterns. Her feet were shod in some beautiful dark indigo polyester shoes with pale indigo lightning bolt patterns.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro measurements look normal,&quot; drawled Dwight Edgmont, looking down at the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, yeah... for a DISASTER AREA!!&quot; gulped Commodore Serenity irksomely.</p>
<p>Walking along, Tammy Smith surprisedly bonked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>&quot;What in Sam Hill was that?&quot; drawled Captain Dwight placidly. Walking along, he suddenly whacked his head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no way we can get through this we'll have to find another way in!&quot; gulped Navigator Tammy slowly. &quot;We have a duty to retrieve the Star Jewel of Eternity!&quot; she groaned slowly. She was looking completely unimpressive in a navy blue nylon jacket and a white rayon skirt with a tacky orange zig zag pattern. The pinstripe cotton boots that were on her feet looked almost new. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she bleated exasperatedly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage! He was looking delightful in a handsome blue green cotton muscle shirt and some violet cotton culottes. Some pink cotton boots were on his feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been a goner without you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he stated fawningly. &quot;I am indebted to you, Captain Dwight,&quot; he said virtuously. &quot;Thank you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he giggled peacefully.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you'd expect. A communications panel seemed to dominate the environment. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity surveyed the area with her eyes. She was sporting a marvellous purple dacron sweater with crimson and violet rayon trim and some fantastic deep violet nylon slacks with frilly red and purple lace. On her feet she wore some elegant crimson and violet cotton boots with purple and violet moon beam patterns. She all of a sudden had a unusual intuition. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; yelled Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;You displayed some quick thinking today, Serenity Starlight!&quot; chirped Captain Dwight virtuously. He was looking ready for action in a mauve cotton long coat. The snappy mauve leather trainers with green stripes that were on his feet looked almost new. &quot;I think I should promote you to Admiral, Serenity Starlight!&quot; he sighed fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; blushed Ms. O'James firmly. &quot;I'm not in this for rank, I do it out of love!&quot;. &quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a hot dog after that,&quot; chirped Joe Mulbury strongly.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont slumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; sighed Tammy Smith energetically.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Captain Dwight,&quot; whispered Commodore Serenity courageously.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-return-of-the-revenge-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">27. The Return of The Revenge of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you'd expect. Not too far away was an air conditioning unit. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the navigation dashboard. She was looking smashing in an elegant shimmering rainbow coloured nylon smock adorned with rubies. The marvellous shimmering rainbow hued leather boots with crimson and violet star patterns on her feet seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the pulsing red and green lights. &quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he said peacefully.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the Captain's chair. He was looking ready for action in a fine pinstripe cotton top with orange rayon trim and some handsome blue green denim culottes. His short black hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. His feet were shod with some snappy navy blue dacron dress shoes with violet cotton trim.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was standing near the Captain's chair. She was looking tastless in a tasteless violet crinkly foil jersey and some white polyester leggings. Her narrow mouth in profile cast a shadow against the air conditioning unit. On her feet she wore some outdated gold coloured dacron pumps.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury motioned Ms. O'James to step back from the others for a moment. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his long auburn locks. He was wearing a handsome orange crinkly foil muscle shirt with gold coloured silk trim and some fine white polyester trousers. Some handsome purple rayon trainers were on his feet. &quot;There's something I wanted to talk about&quot;, he began coyly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, about the other day in the loading bay...&quot; mumbled Commander Joe awkwardly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went beet red with blushing. &quot;It's all right, Joe Mulbury, you don't need to say anything,&quot; she breathed slumblingly.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. He lifted the cup of coffee to eye level. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; he stated blissfully.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;Nebulon!&quot; Tammy Smith yelled.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled hatefully. He put his hand up to his jutting chin. He was looking villanous in a deep black cotton shirt and some midnight black rayon culottes. On his feet he wore some black nylon shoes. &quot;So sorry to spoil your party, chums!&quot; he said with a voice like a giraffe driving a race car. He snatched Commander Joe from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith's mouth gaped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight clapped his hands on his cheeks in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; yelled Commodore Serenity with a voice like a gangster in a jewellery store.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where that villian has taken Joe Mulbury!&quot; muttered Navigator Tammy heavily.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Joe Mulbury is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; intoned Ms. O'James sternly. Her wicked cute forehead in profile threw a shadow on the Captain's chair.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; yelled Tammy Smith impatiently.</p>
<p>With a smooth yet masterful motion, Captain Dwight picked up the star charts that were nearby. He lifted the star charts to eye level. &quot;These star charts represents how I feel inside,&quot; he drawled firmly. This was bad, but he didn't let it dampen his cheer.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon. A torch in a thing on the wall gleamed in the dim torch light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; gasped Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James enigmatically. She was looking delightful in an elegant dark indigo crinkly foil suit jacket with shimmering rainbow hued lacy frills and some elegant black and purple rayon slacks with blue and purple lightning bolt patterns. Her feet were shod with some fantastic purple and violet denim pumps with frilly shimmering rainbow coloured lace.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy started the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro metrics look normal,&quot; bellowed Tammy Smith enigmatically. She was wearing a pinstripe crinkly foil frock and a mauve nylon skirt. The green dacron dress shoes that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, normal... for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!&quot; gulped Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James sadly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, Nebulon appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; barked Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. He was looking impressive in a midnight black polyester top and some dark red rayon culottes. Some fine dark red rayon dress shoes with black stripes were on his feet. &quot;I have you now!&quot; he stated with a voice like charcoal in a performance art piece. He snatched Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy made gestures of shock with her arms.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James shouted &quot;OH NO!&quot;.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith picked up the shards of broken glass that were nearby. She held the shards of broken glass in her hand. &quot;These shards of broken glass represents how I feel inside,&quot; she barked drily.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>&quot;What was that noise?&quot; barked Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>Too quickly for anyone to react, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Tammy Smith just stared, seemingly paralyzed. She was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight made motions of disbelief with her arms. &quot;We must act quickly!&quot; she bleated. She helped dig Navigator Tammy out from the rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; chirped Tammy Smith peacefully.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Ms. O'James drawled enigmatically.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been toast without you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he smiled fawningly. &quot;I am in debt to you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; he stated energetically. He was sporting a chartreuse polyester shirt with mauve crinkly foil trim and some yellow silk leggings with silver coloured stripes. The pinstripe polyester shoes with red rayon trim that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight giggled virtuously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indebted to you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he said enigmatically. He was decked out in a handsome pink polyester muscle shirt and some fine silver coloured leather trousers with white silk trim. His feet were shod with some fine plaid denim trainers. &quot;I would have been toast without you, Captain Dwight,&quot; he chirped laughingly. &quot;Thank you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; he whispered peacefully.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was a sight to behold. There was an air conditioning unit off in the distance. A few Space Mosquitoes flew around.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some ace thinking from you today, Commodore Serenity!&quot; whispered Dwight Edgmont firmly. He was looking ready for action in a handsome plaid denim jersey with floral print stripes and some snappy chartreuse denim trousers. The violet silk sneakers he was looking exciting in seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Admiral, Serenity Starlight!&quot; he whispered lightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Dwight Edgmont!&quot; breathed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James, blushing fiercely like a tiger. She was looking fine in a marvellous silver coloured crinkly foil gown with purple and gold polyester trim. The marvellous gold coloured nylon sneakers with frilly purple and gold lace on her feet seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. &quot;It's enough to know I'm fighting on the side of good!&quot;. &quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; she breathed fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>With a supple yet powerful motion, Dwight Edgmont flumped down on the sofa.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; breathed Navigator Tammy strongly.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-return-of-the-scourge-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">28. The Return of The Scourge of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you'd expect. A view screen gleamed in the fluorescent light. A few Space Bees buzzed around.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was standing near the navigation dashboard. She was looking impressive in an exquisite crimson and purple polyester suit jacket with frilly shiny purple lace and some beautiful gold coloured polyester slacks with midnight black moon beam patterns. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her perky shoulder length rainbow hued locks. The exquisite deep indigo dacron pumps with crimson and violet lacy frills she was looking fine in seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the view screen.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the air conditioning unit. He put his hand up to his wide brow. He was sporting a handsome purple crinkly foil track suit with tan nylon trim. On his feet he wore some snappy purple rayon trainers. He was cracking open walnuts with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That Star Jewel of Eternity, it's pretty special, isn't it?&quot; asked Navigator Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Fighters Command doesn't entrust us with just any old thing, Navigator Tammy,&quot; Captain Dwight stated courageously.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James picked up the star charts that were nearby. She held the star charts in her hand. &quot;These star charts represents how I feel inside,&quot; she stated happily.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight surveyed the area with his eyes. He lifted the Star Jewel of Eternity. All of a sudden, he was distracted. The Star Jewel of Eternity slipped out of his hand.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>A sour look crept across Captain Dwight Edgmont's face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy moved her exquisite yet forceful arm in the direction of him. She was gotten up in a silver coloured leather dress. Some ill fitting white leather shoes graced her feet.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury gestured towards Dwight Edgmont. His perfect brow in profile threw a shadow on the communications panel. He was wearing a snappy plaid denim sweater and some handsome mauve denim culottes with maroon silk trim. On his feet he wore some gold coloured dacron sandals with orange red leather trim.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity glared in the direction of Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Commander Joe gestured to her to step aside from the others for a moment. &quot;There's something I wanted to say to you&quot;, he mumbled slumblingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Commodore Serenity.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, about last night in the loading bay...&quot; mumbled Commander Joe carefully.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James blushed a deep red. &quot;Words are not necessary, Joe Mulbury&quot; she muttered carefully.</p>
<p>Then, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was looking villanous in a blood red crinkly foil robe. Some black polyester trainers with dark black leather trim graced his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;It's YOU!&quot; bellowed Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. &quot;What have we here!&quot; he said with a voice like a ninja in a performance art piece. His jutting chin in profile cast a shadow against the navigation dashboard. He snatched Dwight Edgmont from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Dwight Edgmont with him.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith clapped her hands on the sides of her face in disbelief.</p>
<p>&quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot; bellowed Commander Joe with a voice like a samurai in a rainstorm.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's mouth gawped wide in shock.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where Dwight Edgmont is being held!&quot; raged Navigator Tammy gratingly.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Dwight Edgmont is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; raged Serenity Starlight menacingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; yelled Navigator Tammy firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. There was a torch in a thing on the wall off in the corner. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the chills,&quot; intoned Serenity Starlight grumpily. She was sporting a pale violet crinkly foil frock with shimmering purple lacy frills and some beautiful silvery leather culottes with frilly black and purple lace. The exquisite pale purple crinkly foil sandals with shimmering rainbow coloured star patterns that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro readings look normal,&quot; muttered Joe Mulbury, peering down at his hyper crystal's enviro probe app.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a DUMP!!&quot; gasped Serenity Starlight irksomely. Walking along, she unexpectedly whacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>&quot;What in blazes was that?&quot; splurted Navigator Tammy acidly. Walking along, she suddenly smacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no way we can get through this we'll have to find another way in!&quot; gasped Commodore Serenity drily. &quot;We have a duty to rescue Captain Dwight Edgmont!&quot; she muttered irksomely.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Navigator Tammy bleated weakly. Her shoulder length blonde hair seemed to shine in the dim torch light.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in debt to you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he stated happily. He was resplendent in a mauve polyester jumpsuit with black stripes. His feet were shod with some silver coloured nylon dress shoes. &quot;I would have been a goner without you, Commander Joe,&quot; he smiled obsequiously. &quot;Thank you, Commodore Serenity,&quot; he drawled happily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. Nearby was a navigation dashboard. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James looked around. She was looking impressive in an elegant black and purple silk blouse adorned with jewels and an exquisite multi coloured dacron skirt adorned with jewels. On her feet she wore some marvellous violet crinkly foil trainers with frilly silver and purple lace. She all of a sudden had a unusual inkling. She looked behind the nearby air conditioning unit. She found the Star Jewel of Eternity.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; shouted Dwight Edgmont. &quot;There was some quick action I saw from you today, Ms. O'James!&quot; he chirped courageously. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Admiral, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; he whispered happily. He was looking exciting in a handsome black silk muscle shirt and some fine pinstripe polyester trousers with violet stripes. His feet were shod with some tie dyed silk boots with violet rayon trim.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Dwight Edgmont!&quot; giggled Serenity Starlight lightly. &quot;I'm too modest, I like being a Commodore too!&quot;. &quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; she drawled enigmatically.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a soda right now,&quot; whispered Joe Mulbury fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; whispered Captain Dwight energetically.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Tammy Smith. She was wearing a tie dyed dacron shirt and some orange red polyester slacks. The blue green rayon sandals that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Star Jewel of Eternity, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; whispered Joe Mulbury laughingly.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="28"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-saturnian-orb-of-hope">29. The Saturnian Orb of Hope</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. An air conditioning unit seemed to dominate the environment. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was standing near the navigation dashboard. Her wicked cute forehead seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. She was looking smashing in an exquisite rainbow hued leather dress with dark violet lightning bolt patterns. Some beautiful shiny purple leather dress shoes with frilly silver and purple lace were on her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; chirped Commander Joe Mulbury with an enigmatic twitch of his ears. He was looking delightful in a green rayon robe with maroon stripes. Some fine floral print rayon dress shoes graced his feet.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the communications panel.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the Captain's chair. She was wearing a green silk long coat. On her feet she wore some tacky pinstripe silk sandals.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was cracking open walnuts with the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;That Saturnian Orb of Hope, it's kind of special, isn't it?&quot; asked Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>&quot;It means a lot to all of us, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; Commander Joe breathed happily.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight was intently buffing the Venusian Staff of Power. He was looking exciting in a green leather top and some snappy plaid silk culottes. His feet were shod in some snappy white denim boots.</p>
<p>&quot;That Venusian Staff of Power means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the sort of thing you can just order on Omnizon, Commander Joe,&quot; Captain Dwight drawled placidly.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a security drone flew close by Navigator Tammy Smith's head. &quot;What in Sam Hill was that?&quot; she splurted drily. She frowned acidly.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont looked around. He lifted the Venusian Staff of Power into the light. Without warning, he stubbed his toe. He lost his grip on the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>The Venusian Staff of Power tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont wasn't going to let a little thing like this cramp his style, though. His wide brow in profile threw a shadow on the air conditioning unit. &quot;Uh-oh,&quot; he said quietly.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith looked at him.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury moved his exquisite yet forceful arm in the direction of Dwight Edgmont. His perfect brow seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight gestured towards Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>From out of nowhere, a delivery drone whizzed past Captain Dwight Edgmont's head. &quot;What was that?&quot; he giggled courageously. He beamed courageously.</p>
<p>Commander Joe surveyed the area. He held the Saturnian Orb of Hope in his hand. Without warning, he lost his balance. The Saturnian Orb of Hope slipped out of his hand.</p>
<p>The Saturnian Orb of Hope tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Drat,&quot; groaned Joe Mulbury quietly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy pointed towards him.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight wasn't going to let a little thing like this dampen his cheer, though. He moved his graceful yet firm hand in the direction of Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James gestured towards Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>Commander Joe motioned her to step aside from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I need to talk to you about&quot;, he mumbled enigmatically.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, about that time in the engine room...&quot; muttered Commander Joe painfully.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James blushed a deep red. &quot;It's all right, Commander Joe, you don't need to say anything,&quot; she muttered painfully. She looked around. She all of a sudden had a strange hunch. She looked behind the nearby air conditioning unit. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; exclaimed Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity surveyed the area. She suddenly had a funny hunch. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Saturnian Orb of Hope.</p>
<p>&quot;What a relief!&quot; yelped Dwight Edgmont. &quot;You displayed some top notch thinking today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; he chirped obsequiously. &quot;I think I should promote you to Admiral, Ms. O'James!&quot; he drawled fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; whispered Serenity Starlight, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. &quot;I'm too modest, I like being a Commodore too!&quot;. &quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; she stated strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a pizza right now,&quot; said Commander Joe enigmatically.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont flumped down on the bean bag chair.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a hot dog right now,&quot; chirped Navigator Tammy obsequiously. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her shoulder length blonde hair. &quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Venusian Staff of Power, Captain Dwight,&quot; she drawled calmly.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-return-of-the-menace-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">30. The Return of The Menace of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you'd expect. Some pulsing red and green lights seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Mosquitoes flew around.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was standing near the Captain's chair. She put her hand up to her wicked cute forehead. She was looking smashing in an elegant shiny silver denim jerkin with shiny purple lightning bolt patterns and some WICKED AWESOME silver and purple nylon trousers with frilly silver coloured lace. The elegant crimson denim shoes with shiny purple lightning bolt patterns on her feet seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was leaning on the Captain's chair. &quot;Hello, Ms. O'James,&quot; he drawled obsequiously.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the view screen. He was sporting an orange red leather jersey with silver coloured nylon trim and some white silk culottes with yellow stripes. The silver coloured rayon sneakers with yellow silk trim that he had on looked almost new. His wide brow in profile cast a shadow against the communications panel.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Joe Mulbury,&quot; whispered Navigator Tammy Smith with an enigmatic twitch of her ears.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was studiously cleaning the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;That Venusian Staff of Power means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Commander Joe. He was decked out in a handsome blue crinkly foil trench coat with black denim trim. The fine mauve crinkly foil boots that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;It means a lot to all of us, Commander Joe,&quot; Captain Dwight stated lightly. He looked around. He lifted the Venusian Staff of Power into the light. All of a sudden, he was distracted. He lost his grip on the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>A drone flew by and made off with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>A sheepish look crept across Captain Dwight Edgmont's face.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith glanced unhappily at him. She was looking tastless in a tan dacron robe. On her feet she wore some floral print denim trainers.</p>
<p>Commander Joe moved his exquisite yet forceful hand in the direction of Captain Dwight. His long auburn hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James moved her gentle yet powerful hand in the direction of Dwight Edgmont. She gestured to Commander Joe to step aside from the others for a moment. &quot;There's something I need to talk to you about&quot;, she muttered awkwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Ms. O'James?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight looked away.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Ms. O'James?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>The faces of Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James and Commander Joe moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, ...&quot; groaned Ms. O'James slumblingly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Their faces inched closer and closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, ... there comes a time when...&quot; muttered Ms. O'James painfully.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! He was looking villanous in a handsome deep red dacron jerkin and some black cotton leggings. Some handsome deep black dacron trainers graced his feet. His close cropped green hair seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Nebulon!&quot; Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James screeched.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled wickedly. &quot;We meet again, kiddies!&quot; he whispered with a voice like an elephant in a gymnasium parking lot. He grabbed Navigator Tammy from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with him.</p>
<p>Commander Joe shouted &quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot;.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont clapped his hands to the sides of his face in shock.</p>
<p>&quot;OH NO!&quot; yelled Ms. O'James irritatedly.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where that villian has taken Navigator Tammy!&quot; muttered Commander Joe annoyingly.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Navigator Tammy is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; splurted Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James outrageously.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; screeched Joe Mulbury viciously. He picked up the star charts that were nearby. He held the star charts in his hand. &quot;These star charts represents how I feel inside,&quot; he groaned emphatically.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. Some manacles gleamed in the dim torch light. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; groaned Joe Mulbury drily. He was looking fine in a snappy plaid leather suit jacket and some snappy orange red silk trousers. His feet were shod in some tan nylon sandals.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont started the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro measurements look normal,&quot; drawled Captain Dwight fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, yeah... for a DISASTER AREA!!&quot; droned Commander Joe enigmatically.</p>
<p>Walking along, Captain Dwight unexpectedly whacked his head against an invisible force field. The blue green denim jacket with navy blue stripes he was resplendent in seemed to shine in the dim torch light. On his feet he wore some handsome gold coloured dacron boots.</p>
<p>&quot;What the devil was that?&quot; shouted Commodore Serenity acidly. She was wearing a marvellous deep indigo cotton jumper with blue and purple star patterns and some elegant silvery denim culottes with pale indigo cotton trim. Her feet were shod with some elegant black and purple rayon boots with frilly purple lace. Walking along, she suddenly smacked her head against an invisible force field.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no way we can get through this we'll have to find another way in!&quot; stated Captain Dwight calmly. &quot;We have a duty to rescue Navigator Tammy Smith!&quot; he drawled happily.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the rugged wastes of the planet Forbak.</p>
<hr />
<p>The blasted surface of Forbak was a sight to behold. There was a gravel pit off in the distance. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; muttered Commander Joe downheartedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro metrics look normal,&quot; whispered Dwight Edgmont, peering down at the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. He was resplendent in a handsome floral print crinkly foil suit jacket and some black crinkly foil leggings. Some floral print rayon dress shoes with red stripes were on his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, normal... for a DISASTER AREA!!&quot; intoned Commander Joe irritatedly.</p>
<p>With a smooth yet forceful motion, Ms. O'James picked up the oddly shaped rock that was nearby. She was sporting a marvellous violet rayon robe with frilly indigo lace. The marvellous dark violet polyester pumps adorned with sapphires that were on her feet looked almost new. She held the oddly shaped rock in her hand. &quot;This oddly shaped rock represents how I feel inside,&quot; she mumbled unhappily.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was pretty much what you'd expect. Nearby was a puddle of icky looking liquid. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Dwight Edgmont giggled enigmatically. He was wearing a black rayon track suit with yellow stripes. His feet were shod with some purple dacron shoes.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;I am indebted to you, Joe Mulbury,&quot; she sighed fawningly. She put her hand up to her narrow mouth. &quot;I would have been toast without you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; she breathed laughingly. She was looking completely unimpressive in a chartreuse leather jumpsuit. Some ill fitting orange red rayon pixie boots were on her feet. &quot;Thank you, Commodore Serenity,&quot; she giggled firmly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. An air conditioning unit seemed to dominate the environment. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James surveyed the area with her eyes. She was looking fine in an exquisite rainbow coloured silk jacket with purple and gold silk trim and some shimmering purple polyester slacks adorned with sapphires. On her feet she wore some violet denim dress shoes with multi hued moon beam patterns. She suddenly had a funny hunch. She looked behind the nearby communications panel. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; exclaimed Commander Joe. He was decked out in a purple nylon muscle shirt and some handsome red silk slacks. The white crinkly foil shoes with yellow stripes that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;That was some ace thinking I saw from you today, Serenity Starlight!&quot; said Dwight Edgmont fawningly. He was wearing some maroon denim coveralls. Some handsome blue silk sneakers were on his feet. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Admiral, Ms. O'James!&quot; he smiled enigmatically.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; smiled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James, blushing fiercely like a tiger. &quot;It's enough to know I'm fighting on the side of good!&quot;. &quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; she chirped obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; smiled Captain Dwight courageously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy slumped down on the couch. She was gotten up in a blue denim blouse and a silver coloured dacron skirt. The tie dyed rayon pumps with gaudy purple polka dots that were on her feet looked almost new. &quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Venusian Staff of Power, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; she drawled peacefully.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you'd expect. There were some pulsing red and green lights off in the corner. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights. She was sporting an elegant purple and violet rayon suit jacket with crimson and violet star patterns and some beautiful black and purple crinkly foil trousers with pale purple lacy frills. Her feet were shod in some exquisite shiny silver dacron pumps adorned with gems.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the navigation dashboard. &quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight,&quot; he giggled blissfully.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the communications panel. He was sporting a pink nylon shirt with tan stripes and some gold coloured denim trousers. His wide brow seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. On his feet he wore some maroon silk trainers. &quot;Hello, Ms. O'James,&quot; he giggled with an enigmatic twitch of his mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Commodore Serenity,&quot; said Navigator Tammy Smith with an enigmatic twitch of her ears.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity was cracking open pecans with the Chalice of Dreams. Her wicked cute forehead in profile threw a shadow on the pulsing red and green lights.</p>
<p>&quot;That Chalice of Dreams, it's pretty special, isn't it?&quot; asked Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the kind of thing you can just order on Omnizon, Captain Dwight,&quot; Commodore Serenity said calmly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; shouted Commodore Serenity.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled despicably. She was looking impressive in a fine midnight black leather great coat. Her scarred mouth in profile cast a shadow against the pulsing red and green lights. The snappy midnight black polyester sandals that were on her feet looked almost new. &quot;We meet again, chums!&quot; she sighed with a voice like a tiger in a bazaar. She grabbed Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with her.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith made motions of disbelief with her arms. She was wearing an orange red rayon long coat. Some orange cotton sneakers graced her feet.</p>
<p>Commander Joe shouted &quot;NOOO!&quot;.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's mouth gawped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Commander Joe picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. He lifted the cup of coffee to eye level. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; he muttered threateningly. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his long auburn locks. He was sporting a blue green polyester jerkin and some pink rayon trousers. His feet were shod with some yellow dacron boots.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a surveillance drone whizzed past Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's head. &quot;What in the world was that?&quot; she groaned acidly. She blinked heavily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;It's The Skull Witch!&quot; Ms. O'James yelled.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled wildly. &quot;I have you now!&quot; she smiled with a voice like a tiger in a mosh pit. She grabbed Tammy Smith from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Tammy Smith with her.</p>

<p>Commander Joe Mulbury and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been toast without you, Joe Mulbury,&quot; she breathed obsequiously. &quot;Thank you, Commodore Serenity,&quot; she breathed peacefully.</p>
<p>There was a rumbling sound.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear something?&quot; Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James chirped.</p>
<p>Without warning, with a stupendous crash, the roof of the passage caved in!</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury stood frozen like a deer in headlights. He was buried under rubble.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith put her hands to the sides of her face in disbelief.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's mouth gaped wide in shock.</p>
<p>Then, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; bellowed Serenity Starlight.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled evilly. She was looking impressive in a handsome black nylon leotard with deep red denim trim. On her feet she wore some dark black crinkly foil sandals. &quot;So sorry to spoil your party, kiddies!&quot; she drawled with a voice like a gorilla at a baseball game. She snatched Navigator Tammy from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Navigator Tammy with her.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity made gestures of shock with her hands. &quot;We must find out where Tammy Smith is being held!&quot; she intoned viciously. &quot;I have a strong feeling Navigator Tammy is in the stronghold fortress of Nebulon,&quot; she muttered annoyingly. &quot;Quickly! We must make our way to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; she yelled icily. Walking along, she suddenly bonked her head against an invisible force field. &quot;There's no way we can get through this we'll have to find another way in!&quot; she groaned weakly. &quot;We have a duty to rescue Captain Dwight Edgmont!&quot; she gasped enigmatically.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the rugged wastes of the planet Forbak.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the blasted surface of Forbak. A crumbling arch gleamed in the harsh sun light. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; muttered Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James heavily. She was wearing a crimson and violet dacron hoodie with frilly shiny silver lace and a crimson and violet crinkly foil skirt with pale violet star patterns. The dark violet crinkly foil dress shoes with blue and purple rayon trim that she had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>Suddenly, some Space Slugs attacked Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>A intense battle commenced!</p>
<p>When the dust had cleared, dazed Space Slugs were strewn across the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close one!&quot; raged Commodore Serenity viciously. &quot;It looked like those Space Slugs had Nebulon the Dastardly's insignia on their armor,&quot; she sighed calmly. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. There was a puddle of icky looking liquid off in the distance. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight drawled fawningly. She was sporting an elegant crimson and purple crinkly foil dress with pale indigo lacy frills. The fantastic indigo rayon shoes with shimmering rainbow hued lacy frills that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith was there, locked in a cage! She was gotten up in a tacky chartreuse cotton gown with a tacky white zig zag pattern. On her feet she wore some bleak orange red leather sneakers.</p>
<p>Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in debt to you, Ms. O'James,&quot; she chirped strongly. She wasted no time. She helped dig Joe Mulbury out from the rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no time to lose!&quot; Ms. O'James exclaimed. She helped dig Joe Mulbury out from the rubble.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; smiled Joe Mulbury lightly. &quot;I am in debt to you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he whispered calmly. He was sporting a tie dyed nylon robe. His feet were shod in some fine maroon polyester trainers. He motioned Commodore Serenity to step back from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I need to talk to you about&quot;, he began slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, about last night in the loading bay...&quot; muttered Joe Mulbury slowly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went beet red with blushing. She held her finger up to Commander Joe Mulbury's lips. She surveyed the area with her eyes. She lifted the Chalice of Dreams into the light. All of a sudden, she was distracted. The Chalice of Dreams slipped out of her grip.</p>
<p>The Chalice of Dreams tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>A sour look crept across Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's face.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy pointed towards her.</p>
<p>Commander Joe glared in the direction of Commodore Serenity. He gestured to Serenity Starlight to step back from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I wanted to talk to you about&quot;, he said slumblingly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, about that time in the mess hall...&quot; sighed Commander Joe awkwardly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight went beet red with blushing. &quot;Speak not of it, Commander Joe&quot; she gasped painfully. She looked around. She all of a sudden had a hunch. She looked behind the nearby puddle of icky looking liquid. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; cried Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Serenity Starlight breathed peacefully.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have been toast without you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he whispered blissfully. He was looking exciting in a fine violet silk jacket with silver coloured polyester trim and some handsome pink leather leggings with chartreuse stripes. Some gold coloured nylon shoes graced his feet. &quot;I am in debt to you, Commander Joe,&quot; he said courageously. &quot;I would have been a goner without you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; he said lightly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Commodore Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you'd expect. An air conditioning unit seemed to dominate the environment. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;You displayed some top notch thinking today, Ms. O'James!&quot; giggled Dwight Edgmont blissfully. He was looking ready for action in a handsome yellow rayon shirt with yellow stripes and some tan rayon trousers. The silver coloured nylon trainers that were on his feet looked almost new. &quot;I think I should promote you to Admiral, Serenity Starlight!&quot; he whispered happily.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; blushed Serenity Starlight blissfully. She was wearing an exquisite shimmering multi hued cotton frock with shiny silver moon beam patterns and a beautiful blue and purple polyester skirt with multi coloured star patterns. Her feet were shod with some elegant crimson and purple denim pixie boots with multi hued dacron trim. &quot;I'm not in this for rank, I do it out of love!&quot;. She flumped down on the sofa.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; said Commander Joe obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a curry after that,&quot; sighed Dwight Edgmont obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Navigator Tammy. She was wearing a maroon leather frock and some tasteless gold coloured polyester trousers with gaudy white polka dots. On her feet she wore some brown rayon pixie boots with a tacky chartreuse zig zag pattern.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Chalice of Dreams, Serenity Starlight,&quot; sighed Commander Joe laughingly.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
<p><a name="31"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-scourge-of-the-chalice-of-dreams">32. The Scourge of The Chalice of Dreams</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. In the centre of the area was a communications panel. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was standing near the view screen. Her wicked cute forehead seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. She was looking smashing in some pale violet dacron coveralls with rainbow coloured lacy frills. Some exquisite crimson and violet rayon sandals with shimmering multi hued lacy frills were on her feet.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was playing that new match three game on his hyper crystal. His perfect brow in profile threw a shadow on the air conditioning unit. He was looking smashing in a blue green silk hoodie and some fine blue leather leggings. Some handsome purple dacron dress shoes graced his feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Commander Joe,&quot; said Captain Dwight Edgmont placidly. He was looking ready for action in some mauve polyester coveralls. On his feet he wore some snappy mauve denim dress shoes with mauve stripes.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was leaning on the view screen. She was meticulously cleaning the Chalice of Dreams. The plaid silk robe she was gotten up in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her shoulder length blonde hair. Her feet were shod in some orange red crinkly foil shoes with gaudy silver coloured polka dots.</p>
<p>&quot;That Chalice of Dreams, it's kind of special, isn't it?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Fighters Command doesn't entrust us with just any old thing, Commander Joe,&quot; Navigator Tammy drawled fawningly.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James gestured to Commander Joe to step aside from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I need to talk about&quot;, she muttered awkwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Ms. O'James?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;Um, about the other day in the loading bay...&quot; mumbled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James coyly.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury blushed a deep red. &quot;Hush, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James, there's no need, you know that,&quot; he mumbled slumblingly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy looked around. She held the Chalice of Dreams in her hand. All of a sudden, she was distracted. She lost her grip on the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>A Space Magpie flew by and made off with the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoops,&quot; sighed Navigator Tammy quietly.</p>
<p>Commander Joe looked at her.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight gestured towards Tammy Smith.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James glanced drably at Tammy Smith. She motioned Joe Mulbury to step away from the others for a moment. &quot;There's something I need to talk about&quot;, she said awkwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Serenity Starlight?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, about last night in the mess hall...&quot; said Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James carefully.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury went beet red with blushing. &quot;It's all right, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James, you don't need to say anything,&quot; he gulped slumblingly.</p>
<p>With a gentle yet firm motion, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James picked up the electro wrench that was nearby. She held the electro wrench in her hand. &quot;This electro wrench represents how I feel inside,&quot; she droned sadly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of thin air, The Skull Witch appeared! She put her hand up to her scarred mouth.</p>
<p>This was bad, but Dwight Edgmont didn't let it affect his mood.</p>
<p>&quot;The Skull Witch!&quot; Serenity Starlight screamed.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled despicably. &quot;What have we here!&quot; she breathed with a voice like charcoal at a baseball game. She was looking menacing in a black rayon jumpsuit. The fine midnight black polyester sneakers that she had on looked almost new. She snatched Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Commander Joe with her.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith put her hands to the sides of her face in shock.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont gritted his teeth and determined to stay cheerful. &quot;NOOO!&quot; he cried enigmatically.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight made motions of surprise with her arms.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the Nebulon's fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. A puddle of icky looking liquid gleamed in the dim torch light. A few Space Mosquitoes buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the chills,&quot; said Navigator Tammy irksomely.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro measurements look normal,&quot; drawled Captain Dwight, peering down at the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. He was wearing some gold coloured silk coveralls. The navy blue cotton sneakers that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, sure... for a PIT!!&quot; mumbled Tammy Smith slowly. She was gotten up in a yellow nylon top and some gaudy yellow denim culottes. Her feet were shod with some pink denim trainers.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Ms. O'James shouted emphatically. She was looking fine in a silvery denim jerkin with silvery denim trim and some elegant pale indigo denim culottes with shiny silver lightning bolt patterns. Some elegant silver and purple polyester trainers with red and purple star patterns were on her feet.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he said strongly. He was looking fine in a green leather long coat. On his feet he wore some pink dacron boots. &quot;I would have been lost without you, Captain Dwight,&quot; he chirped enigmatically. &quot;Thank you, Ms. O'James,&quot; he chirped lightly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. An air conditioning unit gleamed in the fluorescent light. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James surveyed the area. She was wearing a rainbow hued dacron robe with midnight black star patterns. On her feet she wore some dark indigo rayon dress shoes adorned with jewels. She suddenly had a funny intuition. She looked behind the nearby navigation dashboard. She found the Chalice of Dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; yelped Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;You displayed some top notch action today, Ms. O'James!&quot; sighed Dwight Edgmont lightly. He was wearing a floral print silk robe with red nylon trim. His feet were shod with some handsome blue denim dress shoes. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Super Admiral, Serenity Starlight!&quot; he whispered firmly. His wide brow in profile cast a shadow against the air conditioning unit.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; sighed Serenity Starlight, blushing fiercely like a bonfire. &quot;It's enough to know I'm fighting on the side of good!&quot;. &quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; she drawled blissfully.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; stated Dwight Edgmont lightly.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a soda after that,&quot; drawled Navigator Tammy laughingly. She was looking frumpy in a maroon polyester blouse with a tacky brown zig zag pattern and some tacky silver coloured cotton slacks. The orange red rayon sandals that were on her feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Chalice of Dreams, Navigator Tammy,&quot; said Captain Dwight firmly.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="32"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-menace-of-the-skull-witch">33. The Menace of The Skull Witch</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you'd expect. There was a Captain's chair off in the distance. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her perky shoulder length rainbow hued hair. She was looking fine in a dark violet dacron robe with silver and purple crinkly foil trim. Some beautiful shiny silver cotton dress shoes with crimson and violet lightning bolt patterns graced her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Serenity Starlight,&quot; whispered Commander Joe Mulbury with an enigmatic twitch of his ears.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the pulsing red and green lights. He was wearing a white silk muscle shirt with blue green silk trim and some fine tan leather leggings. The orange red nylon dress shoes that he had on looked almost new. &quot;Hello, Commander Joe,&quot; he breathed blissfully. He was cracking open pecans with the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;That Venusian Staff of Power means a lot to you, doesn't it?&quot; asked Admiral Serenity.</p>
<p>&quot;Space Fighters Command doesn't entrust us with just any old thing, Ms. O'James,&quot; Captain Dwight stated firmly. He put his hand up to his wide brow.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a cooking drone buzzed by Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James's head. &quot;What the devil was that?&quot; she yelled firmly. She frowned annoyingly. With a graceful yet confident motion, she gestured to Joe Mulbury to step away from the others for a moment. &quot;There's a thing I need to talk about&quot;, she whispered slumblingly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Ms. O'James?&quot; asked Commander Joe. His perfect brow in profile cast a shadow against the view screen. He was looking impressive in a plaid rayon hoodie and some mauve polyester trousers. On his feet he wore some yellow polyester shoes.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James scratched her neck.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>The faces of Joe Mulbury and Admiral Serenity moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James looked away.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Admiral Serenity?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>Their faces inched closer and closer.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, ...&quot; sighed Serenity Starlight slumblingly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Ms. O'James?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>The faces of Joe Mulbury and Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity put her hand behind her head.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Admiral Serenity?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>The faces of Admiral Serenity and Commander Joe moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight scratched her head.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Ms. O'James?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury.</p>

<p>Admiral Serenity scratched her neck.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury.</p>

<p>Their faces inched closer and closer.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James looked away.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Serenity Starlight?&quot; asked Joe Mulbury.</p>
<p>Their faces inched closer and closer.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, ...&quot; said Admiral Serenity coyly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Admiral Serenity?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>The faces of Commander Joe and Serenity Starlight moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity looked away.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Serenity Starlight?&quot; asked Commander Joe.</p>
<p>The faces of Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James and Commander Joe moved centimeters closer.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, ... there comes a time when...&quot; sighed Serenity Starlight painingly.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont surveyed the area with his eyes. He lifted the Venusian Staff of Power to eye level. All of a sudden, he stumbled. He lost his grip on the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>The Venusian Staff of Power tumbled and rolled away out of sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Oops,&quot; breathed Captain Dwight quietly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith moved her smooth yet powerful arm in the direction of him. She was looking frumpy in a chartreuse rayon sweater with gaudy blue polka dots and a gaudy tie dyed rayon skirt. Some blue green silk trainers were on her feet. Her narrow mouth seemed to glow in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury glanced irksomely at Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight moved her graceful yet forceful arm in the direction of Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a security drone flew close by Commander Joe Mulbury's head. &quot;What the devil was that?&quot; he raged outrageously. He blinked firmly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, The Skull Witch appeared! She was looking villanous in a snappy black rayon jerkin with dark red dacron trim and some fine blood coloured cotton trousers. Her feet were shod with some dark red rayon boots with deep black nylon trim.</p>
<p>&quot;YOU!&quot; yelled Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James.</p>
<p>The Skull Witch cackled evilly. &quot;What have we here!&quot; she sighed with a voice like a rabid dog at a baseball game. She snatched Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, she disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with her.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith's mouth gawped wide in disbelief.</p>
<p>Commander Joe shouted &quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot;.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight bellowed &quot;Nooooooooooooo!&quot;.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the Nebulon's fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. A door to the dungeon seemed to dominate the environment. A few Space Mosquitoes buzzed around.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like the look of this place,&quot; said Admiral Serenity grumpily. She was looking fine in a beautiful red and purple silk sweater with shiny silver lightning bolt patterns and some multi hued silk slacks with purple and violet star patterns. Her feet were shod in some elegant crimson and purple silk boots with red and purple moon beam patterns.</p>
<p>Joe Mulbury dialed up the enviro probe app on his hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro readings look normal,&quot; groaned Joe Mulbury strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;Normal, yeah... for a DUMP!!&quot; mumbled Ms. O'James irksomely.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Joe Mulbury shouted strongly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage!</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in debt to you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he whispered placidly. &quot;Thank you, Joe Mulbury,&quot; he sighed courageously. The snappy violet nylon sweater he was sporting seemed to glow in the dim torch light. The red polyester sandals with floral print stripes that he had on looked almost new. &quot;I would have been a goner without you, Serenity Starlight,&quot; he chirped peacefully.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you'd expect. In the centre of the area was a Captain's chair. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight looked around. She was wearing an exquisite deep violet rayon suit jacket adorned with gems and a beautiful shimmering rainbow hued nylon skirt with gold coloured star patterns. Some exquisite deep violet denim boots with red and purple lightning bolt patterns graced her feet. She suddenly had a funny hunch. She looked behind the nearby view screen. She found the Venusian Staff of Power.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a relief!&quot; cried Navigator Tammy.</p>
<p>&quot;That was some quick action from you today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; smiled Captain Dwight firmly. He was resplendent in a handsome silver coloured silk jumpsuit with white polyester trim. On his feet he wore some handsome white nylon boots. &quot;I think I should promote you to Super Admiral, Admiral Serenity!&quot; he said fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; blushed Serenity Starlight placidly. &quot;I'm too modest, I like being a Admiral too!&quot;. She flumped down on the bean bag chair.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; giggled Commander Joe fawningly.</p>
<p>&quot;I could really go for a soda after that,&quot; sighed Captain Dwight energetically.</p>
<p>Tammy Smith flumped down on the couch. &quot;Maybe next time you'll be more careful with that Venusian Staff of Power, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; she chirped peacefully.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>

<h2 id="the-return-of-the-space-badgers">34. The Return of The Space Badgers</h2>
<p>All was quiet on the bridge of the Starship Dolphin. A Captain's chair seemed to dominate the environment. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the pulsing red and green lights. She was looking delightful in an elegant purple denim tank top with frilly silver coloured lace and some beautiful pale indigo nylon slacks with purple rayon trim. On her feet she wore some beautiful crimson and purple silk sandals with purple and violet moon beam patterns.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury was standing near the view screen.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was standing near the Captain's chair. &quot;Hello, Commander Joe,&quot; he said with an enigmatic twitch of his mouth. His wide brow in profile threw a shadow on the view screen.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Commander Joe,&quot; said Navigator Tammy Smith energetically. The chartreuse nylon coveralls with gaudy mauve polka dots she was looking frumpy in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. Her feet were shod in some red dacron sandals. Her shoulder length blonde hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Commander Joe gestured to Ms. O'James to step away from the others for a moment. He was wearing a handsome plaid silk track suit with pink stripes. Some handsome maroon denim shoes graced his feet. &quot;There's a thing I wanted to talk to you about&quot;, he mumbled carefully.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Joe Mulbury?&quot; asked Ms. O'James.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, about that time in the mess hall...&quot; whispered Joe Mulbury slowly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James blushed a deep red. Her wicked cute forehead in profile threw a shadow on the navigation dashboard. She held her finger up to Commander Joe Mulbury's lips.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, a messenger drone flew close by Navigator Tammy Smith's head. &quot;What in the world was that?&quot; she bellowed exasperatedly. She grimaced sternly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared! The fine midnight black silk sweater he was looking menacing in seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light. The handsome deep red polyester trainers that were on his feet looked almost new. His close cropped green hair seemed to gleam in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Nebulon!&quot; Ms. O'James screeched.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled hatefully. &quot;I have you now!&quot; he chirped with a voice like a baboon in a video arcade. He snatched Joe Mulbury from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Joe Mulbury with him.</p>
<p>&quot;OH NO!&quot; screeched Tammy Smith with a voice like a gangster in a performance art piece.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont clapped his hands on the sides of his face in shock.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James made gestures of surprise with her hands. She picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She held the cup of coffee in her hand. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; she bellowed irritatedly. From out of nowhere, a messenger drone buzzed by her head. &quot;What in blazes was that?&quot; she barked irritatedly. She blinked heavily.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the Nebulon's fortress stronghold.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. Nearby was a torch in a thing on the wall. A Space Mouse scurried by.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the willies,&quot; intoned Admiral Serenity drably. She was looking fine in an exquisite deep violet denim suit jacket with crimson and violet lightning bolt patterns and some marvellous pale purple silk culottes with purple lightning bolt patterns. On her feet she wore some elegant crimson and violet silk shoes with dark purple dacron trim.</p>
<p>&quot;Enviro readings look normal,&quot; drawled Captain Dwight, looking down at his hyper crystal's enviro probe app. He was looking exciting in an orange red cotton suit jacket and some green rayon culottes with tie dyed stripes. The handsome floral print denim dress shoes that were on his feet looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, normal... for a TOXIC WASTE SITE!!&quot; mumbled Ms. O'James unhappily.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James were attacked by some Space Badgers.</p>
<p>A intense skirmish had begun!</p>
<p>&quot;BY THE MOUNTAINS OF MARS!!!&quot; screamed Tammy Smith. She drew the electro mace out of her backpack. She lifted the electro mace above her head. She brought down the electro mace with a mighty movement. She was gotten up in a tacky purple nylon jersey and some floral print crinkly foil culottes. Some bleak pinstripe leather sneakers with a tacky chartreuse zig zag pattern graced her feet.</p>
<p>The electro mace made contact with the Space Badgers with a awesome whack.</p>
<p>The Space Badgers went flying across the room. When the dust had settled, dazed Space Badgers were strewn across the battlefield.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close call!&quot; yelled Tammy Smith viciously.</p>
<p>&quot;It looked like those Space Badgers had The Skull Witch's insignia on their clothes,&quot; stated Ms. O'James peacefully. &quot;Remember to include that in the report when we get home.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;IF we get home,&quot; said Navigator Tammy enigmatically. &quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; she he gulpedavily.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James turned a corner.</p>
<p>Commander Joe was there, locked in a cage! His perfect brow in profile cast a shadow against the torch in a thing on the wall.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Commander Joe.</p>
<p>&quot;I am in debt to you, Navigator Tammy,&quot; he smiled peacefully. &quot;I would have been toast without you, Dwight Edgmont,&quot; he drawled laughingly. He was looking fine in a handsome tan denim sweater and some green crinkly foil culottes with navy blue silk trim. His feet were shod in some white cotton trainers. &quot;I am in debt to you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he stated placidly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>All was quiet on the bridge. There were some pulsing red and green lights off in the corner. It was truly an unusual sight.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some quick action I saw from you today, Ms. O'James!&quot; drawled Captain Dwight laughingly. He was looking exciting in a fine silver coloured rayon smock with tie dyed silk trim. His feet were shod with some handsome orange leather sneakers with orange red denim trim. &quot;How would you like a promotion to the rank of Super Admiral, Ms. O'James!&quot; he whispered virtuously.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Captain Dwight!&quot; said Admiral Serenity, blushing fiercely like a tiger. She was looking impressive in a marvellous rainbow coloured cotton smock with crimson dacron trim. On her feet she wore some exquisite rainbow coloured rayon sneakers with rainbow coloured lacy frills. &quot;I'm not in this for rank, I do it out of love!&quot;. &quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; she smiled obsequiously.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; smiled Joe Mulbury placidly. The snappy brown crinkly foil jumpsuit he was sporting seemed to shine in the fluorescent light. The fine floral print cotton trainers that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Captain Dwight.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we all learned a valuable lesson today,&quot; chirped Tammy Smith strongly. She was looking tastless in a mauve dacron sweater with gaudy pinstripe polka dots and a violet leather skirt. Some mauve rayon boots with gaudy green polka dots graced her feet.</p>
<p>They all laughed.</p>
<p><a name="34"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-return-of-the-secret-of-nebulon-the-dastardly">35. The Return of The Secret of Nebulon the Dastardly</h2>
<p>The bridge of the Starship Dolphin was pretty much what you'd expect. A navigation dashboard gleamed in the fluorescent light. A few Space Mosquitoes buzzed around.</p>
<p>Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James was leaning on the view screen. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on her perky shoulder length rainbow hued locks. She was wearing an elegant shiny purple dacron shirt adorned with rubies and some purple and violet rayon trousers with shimmering rainbow coloured moon beam patterns. The pale purple crinkly foil shoes with frilly red and purple lace she was sporting seemed to shine in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>Captain Dwight Edgmont was leaning on the view screen. He was looking ready for action in a black crinkly foil smock with orange red nylon trim. The plaid cotton sneakers that he had on looked almost new. &quot;Hello, Commander Joe Mulbury,&quot; he sighed with an enigmatic twitch of his nose.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith was playing that new match three game on her hyper crystal. Her narrow mouth seemed to glow in the fluorescent light. &quot;Hello, Captain Dwight,&quot; she breathed peacefully. She was looking completely unimpressive in a tacky red cotton leotard. Some white polyester sneakers graced her feet.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. She lifted the cup of coffee into the light. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; she whispered courageously.</p>
<p>From out of nowhere, a security drone buzzed by Commander Joe Mulbury's head. &quot;What was that?&quot; he shouted strongly. He blinked firmly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, out of thin air, Nebulon the Dastardly appeared!</p>
<p>&quot;Nebulon!&quot; Tammy Smith bellowed.</p>
<p>Nebulon cackled despicably. &quot;We meet again, kiddies!&quot; he smiled with a voice like a gangster in a performance art piece. He put his hand up to his jutting chin. He was gotten up in a midnight black leather jumpsuit. His feet were shod in some snappy deep red rayon shoes. He snatched Captain Dwight from behind. In a flash, he disappeared into thin air, taking Captain Dwight with him.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith's mouth opened wide in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;OH NO!&quot; bellowed Commander Joe irritatedly.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight yelled &quot;NOOO!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We must find out where Dwight Edgmont is being held!&quot; yelled Tammy Smith emphatically.</p>
<p>&quot;I have a strong feeling Captain Dwight is in the Nebulon's fortress stronghold,&quot; raged Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James strongly.</p>
<p>&quot;Set course for the stronghold fortress of Nebulon!,&quot; screeched Navigator Tammy outrageously.</p>
<p>Commander Joe picked up the cup of coffee that was nearby. With a soft yet powerful motion, he lifted the cup of coffee to eye level. His perfect brow in profile cast a shadow against the communications panel. He was decked out in a violet dacron track suit with floral print stripes. On his feet he wore some silver coloured rayon sneakers. &quot;This cup of coffee represents how I feel inside,&quot; he said emphatically.</p>
<p>Commander Joe Mulbury travelled to the stronghold fortress of Nebulon.</p>
<hr />
<p>The stronghold fortress of Nebulon was a sight to behold. Not too far away was a torch in a thing on the wall. A few Space Mosquitoes flew around.</p>
<p>&quot;This place gives me the willies,&quot; groaned Joe Mulbury heavily.</p>
<p>Ms. O'James launched the enviro probe app on her hyper crystal. &quot;Enviro readings look normal,&quot; muttered Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James drily. The fantastic purple dacron shirt with deep indigo star patterns she was decked out in seemed to glow in the dim torch light. Some fantastic shimmering purple silk trainers with midnight black star patterns were on her feet.</p>
<p>&quot;... For a DUMP!!&quot; mumbled Commander Joe grumpily. He motioned Serenity Starlight to step back from the others for a moment. The yellow nylon muscle shirt he was looking delightful in seemed to gleam in the dim torch light. The gold coloured polyester trainers with tie dyed stripes that he had on looked almost new.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Commander Joe?&quot; asked Admiral Serenity.</p>
<p>&quot;Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James, you are so exquisitely beautiful, like a jewel,&quot; chirped Joe Mulbury. &quot;I must kiss you!&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Commander Joe!&quot; blushed Serenity Starlight energetically.</p>
<p>Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James and Joe Mulbury kissed! And they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed and they kissed! &quot;Oh, Commander Joe!&quot; she smiled courageously.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's keep moving,&quot; Joe Mulbury whispered courageously.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James went around a corner.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont was there, locked in a cage! He was sporting a maroon cotton jumpsuit with yellow stripes. On his feet he wore some fine mauve nylon trainers.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James together broke the cage and pulled out Dwight Edgmont.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Tammy Smith,&quot; he smiled firmly. &quot;Thank you, Joe Mulbury,&quot; he chirped laughingly. &quot;I would have been a goner without you, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James,&quot; he smiled fawningly.</p>
<p>Navigator Tammy Smith, Commander Joe Mulbury, Captain Dwight Edgmont, and Admiral Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James travelled to the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bridge was pretty much what you'd expect. There was a navigation dashboard off in the corner. There seemed to be electricity in the air.</p>
<p>&quot;You displayed some top notch thinking today, Serenity Starlight Warhammer O'James!&quot; whispered Captain Dwight strongly. He was sporting a handsome orange cotton jerkin and some floral print denim trousers. His feet were shod with some yellow leather dress shoes. The fluorescent light of the bridge cast highlights on his short black locks. &quot;I think I should promote you to Super Admiral, Serenity Starlight!&quot; he sighed enigmatically.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Dwight Edgmont!&quot; chirped Serenity Starlight, blushing fiercely like a tiger. She was looking delightful in an exquisite multi hued cotton tank top adorned with sapphires and some elegant purple and gold cotton slacks with gold coloured lightning bolt patterns. The fantastic shimmering rainbow hued silk boots with violet star patterns that she had on looked almost new. &quot;I'm too modest, I like being a Admiral too!&quot;. &quot;I could really go for a parmo after that,&quot; she whispered energetically.</p>
<p>&quot;All in a day's work for the Space Fighters!&quot; drawled Commander Joe courageously.</p>
<p>Dwight Edgmont flumped down on the couch.</p>
<p>&quot;What an adventure that was!&quot; exclaimed Tammy Smith. She was wearing a blue green nylon suit jacket and some navy blue denim leggings with gaudy tan polka dots. Some violet leather trainers were on her feet.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed.</p>
